View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, BlackRock cuts the price to invest in its largest stock index fund, previewing the Fed s policy statement, and bitcoin s long, long slump. 1. A new round of high level U.S. China trade talks is set for next week, with negotiators seeking a deal by late April. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the White House last month. PHOTO: ALEX WONG/GETTY IMAGES U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to fly to Beijing next week to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is expected to lead a Chinese delegation to Washington to continue talks the week after. The deal they are working toward would include substantial increases in U.S. exports to China, and Chinese pledges to better protect intellectual property, end pressure on U.S. companies to transfer technology to their Chinese partners and reduce subsidies for Chinese companies. But other issues remain. Meanwhile, China s President Xi Jinping is set to begin a trip to Italy and France at a time of division in Europe about how to deal with China: as a business opportunity, or a would be hegemon out to reshape the international order. 2. The Fed s two day meeting ends today, with a policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT. It is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and could indicate plans to hold steady for a while. The Fed has also signaled it s ready to say when this year it will stop winding down its $4 trillion asset portfolio. What else to watch for. With markets already cheering the asset plan, the Fed turns to a crucial issue: the mix of Treasurys it should hold. From reporter Nick Timiraos: Markets want to know how the Fed s recent patient stance will translate into Wednesday s quarterly economic projections. In December, most officials projected a strong enough economy to warrant one to three rate increases this year. Now there is a distinct prospect a majority won t project any. What may get less attention is their estimates of the unemployment rate and the short term interest rate over the long run further signals of how much need they see to raise rates in the year ahead. nick.timiraos wsj.com 3. BlackRock will charge the least it ever has for an index mutual fund, closing the gap with rivals such as Vanguard and Fidelity. Starting in July the giant money manager will cut the cheapest new share class of the iShares S P 500 Index Fund to $1.25 from $4 for every $10,000 for investors putting up at least $2.5 billion. Cuts for other investor shares in the approximately $18 billion fund will be more modest. The reduction reflects the relentless price pressure Wall Street firms face on their most common stock and bond investments. In 2018, the average equity fund tied to an index charged 0.08% $8 for every $10,000 down by more than half from a decade earlier. 4. Bitcoin is in the longest slump of its 10 year history, forcing even ardent supporters to shelve dreams of global disruption and focus on simply outlasting the downturn. Also wounded in the crash: many companies and technology platforms that promised to transform institutions from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, and raised billions of dollars through initial coin offerings. From reporter Paul Vigna: When bitcoin started falling after its record run in 2017, the faithful figured it was just another one of the cryptocurrency s familiar jolts, and the proverbial rocket shot to the moon would soon resume. That was 15 months ago. Now businesses are cutting costs and laying off employees, startups are going out of business, and everybody s looking in their wallets and hoping they can stretch what s there until the next bull run. paul.vigna wsj.com Advertisement LEAVE THIS BOX EMPTY Share this email with a friend.

PHOTO: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS Mr. Trump said he intends to designate Brazil as the U.S. s 18th major non NATO ally, meaning preferential access to U.S. military equipment and more training opportunities with the U.S. For Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro represents a much needed ally in Latin America as the U.S. tries to oust Venezuela s Nicol s Maduro.

After locking up as many as a million people in camps in Xinjiang, Chinese authorities are destroying Uighur neighborhoods and purging the region s culture. They say they re fighting terrorism. Their aim: to engineer a society loyal to Beijing. PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: SHARON SHI VIDEO: CL MENT B RGE In Urumqi, an old Silk Road city in China s Xinjiang region, a state security campaign that has already detained vast numbers of people has moved to its next stage: demolishing neighborhoods and purging their culture, down to its flatbread. Urumqi s transformation is the leading edge of a campaign by China s Communist Party to forcibly assimilate the Uighurs. Ethnic unity is the lifeline of all ethnic groups in China and the foundation of economic progress in Xinjiang. Shohrat Zakir, governor of Xinjiang, at China's annual legislative session 7.

NBC Could China s experimental ship be the world s biggest nuclear powered icebreaker? South China Morning Post 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about the Trump administration's proposal to limit some student borrowing: Timothy O Dowd, New Hampshire I am a father with four children finishing my degree online and utilizing student loans. I also attended college right after high school for 3 years part time. If one decides to pursue a higher education, assistance should be available at an amount that is reasonable to cover certain costs. A baseline should be established through averages for schools that get the job done, as in community colleges and/or in state tuition. It is not an entitlement to attend a private or prestigious school. Alondra Garcia, Virginia There are caps on your credit card, the value of a house/auto you can buy, personal loans etc. based on your credit score, so why should student loans be treated differently? That being said, I think the amount of student loans granted should be based on the area of study. If the average annual salary of an entry level philosophy major/professional is $25,000 versus a finance major/professional at $45,000, why are we granting the same amount? This gets into the social implications of hindering someone s ability to go to college because they prefer one program over the other but let s be real: A simple discounted cash flow analysis could provide better information as to what amount to lend with reasonable expectations the loan will be paid back in full. Terry Hlivko, Arizona There should be a list furnished to all students that indicated what their degree will give them, in salary, the first year out of school and the average thereafter. If your degree will not provide you with a living wage, how do you expect to pay off your loans? Barry Zalma, California Some people, with one class in a community college, live off the loans and don t ever have to pay them back and are never able to pay them back. If you can t afford to go to college get a job, earn and save some money and then pay your way or go to College of the Ozarks, which charges no tuition but makes students work. Kill the government backed student loan program and you will see tuition drop like the temperature in Omaha in December.

The data set CSV size is 1.2mb and the problems I encountered are how to do the explore data analysis and get insight from feature engineering. For the EDA, my main work were to explore the connection inside data,to convert type of variables and to deal with NAN and outliers. I used some visualization packages like Seaborn pairplot to find the leverage point directly and also used some statistical methods like Cook s distance. After defining training and testing data set, I divided the feature engineering into two part. One was about classification to decide the threshold. Some machine learning algorithms such as logistics regression, decision tree, boosting were used in this part. Then I performed ridge regression to find the variables which have effect on response variables. By ridge regression, I got the significant variables and interaction, and reduced the multicollinearity while.

Message clipped View entire message\", \"The 10-Point: A Guide to the Day's Top News Apple's new services reviewing how the FAA approves jets lots of red ink for Lyft Trouble viewing this email? View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, Apple launches a suite of new services, lawyer Michael Avenatti is charged in two federal cases, and Lyft bleeds red ink ahead of its IPO. 1. President Trump offered praise for Robert Mueller as his 2020 campaign ramped up efforts to use the special counsel s findings as a political weapon. Mr. Trump signaled he would support the public release of Mr. Mueller s full report, which he says exonerates him. Democrats set a deadline next week for the delivery of the full report to Congress and said they would press other investigations involving the president. Mr. Mueller told top Justice Department officials three weeks before submitting his report that he wouldn t reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, according to a person familiar with the matter. Questions remain over how much of the Mueller report Attorney General William Barr will share with Congress and the American public, and whether Democrats will push for more. WSJ s Gerald F. Seib explains. Photos: Getty President Trump is off the hook, but Russian President Vladimir Putin isn t, writes the Journal s Gerald F. Seib. George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign adviser who helped trigger the Mueller investigation, says in new a book he didn t lie to investigators, contradicting what he told a federal judge. 2. Apple announced a suite of new services, marking a major strategic shift as it seeks fresh growth. Actresses Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston spoke during Apple s launch of TV , a service for its first original TV shows, in Cupertino, Calif., on Monday. PHOTO: DAVID PAUL MORRIS/BLOOMBERG NEWS The new products extend its reach in entertainment, financial services, news and videogames. A new video subscription service will carry original programming and its TV app, which will carry that content, will also be made available on competitors devices. Apple also launched a credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs. In addition, the company unveiled Apple News , a premium version of its existing news app. The $9.99 a month news service will provide access to articles from more than 300 magazines and newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal through an agreement with parent Dow Jones Co. From reporter Joe Flint: Apparently making TV shows can improve humanity. That was the message from Apple CEO Tim Cook as he unveiled the tech giant s original programming plans. Apple, he said, has always tried to make the world a better place and its shows can contribute something important to our culture and society and change the world. Even Oprah Winfrey showed up to praise Apple for helping us rise to our best selves. She promised to illuminate consciousness and build greater awareness through compelling conversation. While Apple was high on aspirations, it was light on details. Apple didn t provide any sneak peeks at its shows beyond a brief sizzle reel or say how much Apple TV would cost. As for launch timing, the fall was as close as Apple would come to a specific date, so set your alarm for sometime between Sept. 21 and Dec. 20. joseph.flint wsj.com 3. The CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde Gebremariam, said a stall prevention system on Boeing s 737 MAX appears to have activated on a jet that crashed earlier this month the first time an aviation official familiar with the flight has specifically said that the system could have been switched on during the accident. That system has been under scrutiny in another deadly 737 MAX crash last year. The U.S. Department of Transportation is creating a special committee to review the FAA s safety approval process for the 737 MAX, the latest sign of stepped up scrutiny of the grounded jets. 4. Michael Avenatti, who seized the spotlight last year as a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, was arrested and charged with bank fraud and attempting to extort more than $20 million from Nike. The U.S. attorney s office in Los Angeles alleged that Mr. Avenatti embezzled a client s money and defrauded a bank. In Manhattan, federal prosecutors charged Mr. Avenatti with extortion and conspiracy, alleging he told lawyers for Nike that he and an unnamed co conspirator would release damaging information if Nike didn t pay them. In a brief appearance outside the federal court in New York, Mr. Avenatti said he expects to be fully exonerated when all of the facts of the cases emerge. The co conspirator in the Nike case is celebrity attorney Mark Geragos, people familiar with the matter said. He wasn t charged in the complaint. A lawyer for Mr. Geragos declined to comment.

With its IPO expected this week, Lyft will stand as the biggest test of the public market s appetite for unprofitability since the dot com era. The ride hailing company posted a loss of $911 million last year, the most of any U.S. startup in the 12 months preceding its IPO. Lyft could soon be eclipsed by Uber, however, which has been losing more than $800 million a quarter and has plans to go public later this year. Many other highly funded startups with a similar propensity for heavy spending are considering listing as they age, such as WeWork, which said its annual loss doubled to nearly $2 billion. Uber is buying Middle Eastern rival Careem for $3.1 billion, the company s biggest acquisition yet. From reporter Eliot Brown: The caricature of the dot com boom and bust was that the Silicon Valley companies of the late 1990s were bloated with funding and bleeding cash. But the main element enabling losses like those today at Lyft and Uber private capital is in far greater supply now. When Amazon posted its largest ever loss $1.4 billion in 2000, when it was six years old it had raised under $100 million in equity and over $2 billion in debt. Ten year old Uber has raised just shy of $20 billion in debt and equity and loses about $800 million a quarter. eliot.brown wsj.com 6. Meet William Rick Singer, the self proclaimed higher education guru federal authorities now call the mastermind of the largest college admissions scam they have ever seen. At the heart of the scandal, dubbed Operation Varsity Blues, is the question of how Mr. Singer recruited so many parents over such a long period of time. One answer can be found in the financial services speaking circuit, which allowed Mr. Singer to move through elite circles in finance, tech and entertainment. It was like he had the magic elixir that would get your kid into school. Betsy Brown Braun, a parenting expert A dozen defendants, including prominent college coaches as well as administrators who allegedly arranged for fraudulently boosted ACT or SAT scores, appeared in federal court as part of the largest college admissions scandal ever prosecuted by the Justice Department. 7. What We re Following Fire billowed from buildings in Gaza City late Monday after the Israeli military said it struck Hamas targets in the area. PHOTO: MAHMUD HAMS/AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES Israeli Strikes: Israel s military said it struck dozens of Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, and the Islamist group launched numerous rockets into Israeli territory. Brexit Power: Britain s Parliament moved to pry control of the Brexit process away from Prime Minister Theresa May, forcing votes on alternatives to her plan. Fed Nominee: Former Trump campaign adviser Stephen Moore, the president s latest pick for a Federal Reserve Board seat, said the central bank s policy pivot shows he was right to criticize its December rate increase. Citi Move: Citigroup is starting a consumer payments business, offering big merchants a suite of options ranging from credit cards to digital wallets. Teacher Salary: Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is proposing a $315 billion plan to increase pay for public school teachers. 8. Trending Stories at WSJ.com Nintendo plans to launch two new versions of its Switch gaming console as early as this summer. Read With fewer men buying suits, retailers of tailored clothing are trying to adapt to a world with relaxed dress codes. Read 9. What Else We re Reading Across tech land, investors who helped nurture startup unicorns are now getting ready to embody a different animal metaphor: the peacock. New York Times Rafi Eitan, one of the founders of Israel s intelligence community and leader of the 1960 operation that captured Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann, died at age 92. Associated Press 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about the Mueller report s findings: Charles Bertolette, California The lie that Trump colluded with Russia to sway the election in his favor has been circling the globe for 675 days. On day 676, the truth finally got its boots on. The bottom line? Unless the liars are punished, they will never stop lying. John A. Hinman, California I want to read the entire report. I can accept there isn t enough evidence that Trump was a traitor to prosecute but I saw enough with my own eyes from Russia, give me the emails to slavish sucking up to Putin to believe that Trump is a useful idiot who has been manipulated by the Russian secret services. That may be the real conclusion of the actual report if we are allowed to see it. Is that as bad as being a traitor? In my book it is. Raj Lalwaney, Virginia Why did it have to take two years and $25 million to come to an inconsequential conclusion? Barry Rose, Nebraska I was hoping that the Mueller report s findings would finally put an end to this supreme waste of taxpayer money what was the final bill, anyway? . However, by failing to exonerate the president for obstruction of justice as he should have, his passive aggressive response just encouraged the sore losercrats to continue this farce. Marsha Jaroch, Colorado The antipathy toward Trump and the refusal by many to acknowledge his election drove the need for a special counsel. Now that this report has come out exonerating the president, the beat will go on to find some rationale for bringing him down. As an independent, I am beseeching the Democrats to stop the investigations and start legislating for health care, infrastructure, comprehensive immigration reform. We need to unite as a nation. Show us this maturity and perhaps you have a chance to win in 2020. John Fischer, Georgia While not conclusive, the Mueller report serves to clarify the Trump campaign s relationship to, and influence by, Russia and Russia s clearly purposeful intrusion in the 2016 election. However, minus total exoneration, the Democratic Party will intensify the total political polarization of government by continuing its incessant probes and investigations through the 2020 elections. While our system of government remains basically sound, our political processes in this country are irreparably broken. Elliot Katz, New York If the Mueller report had concluded that Trump could walk on water, the Democrats would immediately launch an investigation into the environmental impact.

View in web browser Technology In today s letter: New ways to watch sports the unfulfilled promise of space colonies and the perils of posting pictures of your kids. But first ... Credit: Associated Press Silicon Valley s biggest social media companies last week found themselves engaged in the world s worst game of Whac A Mole. The New Zealand mosque massacre Friday was streamed live on Facebook, then posted on YouTube, Twitter and elsewhere. The companies scrambled once again to scrub their platforms of content likely not envisioned when their founders created such egalitarian broadcasting tools. The shootings were a gruesome reminder of how social media can be used to spread terror, and how powerless the tech giants are in stopping it no matter how many dollars and lines of code they throw at the problem. It s not just the horrifying real time stream that s troubling, but stuff that exists online every day, says columnist Christopher Mims. When the alleged shooter filled his purported rant and live stream with references to unsavory memes and in jokes, he laid bare the commonalities between terrorism and trolling. Trolls seek to trigger their ideological enemies, and to sow discord. That s also what the shooter hoped for, he says. Brian Fitzgerald Wilson Rothman Share this email with a friend.

Joanna remedies that with a tutorial on the very real, very creepy reasons you should think twice about sharing photos of your kids online especially with accounts that are not private. What s Going On Click Bait: Amazon tested a pop up feature on its app that in some instances hawked its own private label goods on rivals product pages, forcing customers to either click through or dismiss the pitches. S3XY Time: Elon Musk unveiled the Model Y compact sport utility vehicle it joins the Models S, 3 and X his next big bet for Tesla to appeal to a wider swath of electric car buyers. Sour Notes: Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, alleging the iPhone unfairly uses its App Store to stifle competition, a new salvo in the broader battle over how and whether to rein in tech giants. Apple fired back. Chris Cross: Two senior Facebook executives, longtime product chief Chris Cox and WhatsApp head Chris Daniels abruptly exited the company, just as it shifts to focus on private messaging. 5 and 10: Verizon will charge an additional $10 a month for subscribers who want to add 5G speeds to their phones, the first major U.S. carrier to disclose pricing for the faster service.

Reader Mailbag: Your Tech Questions This week, Personal Tech columnist Joanna Stern answers pressing tech questions. Got one of your own? Reply to this email or write to us at personaltech wsj.com. Q: Our family uses a private messaging service to share lots of photos. Are our pictures and chats safely walled off from public exposure? A: Yes, private messaging apps like Apple s Messages and Facebook s WhatsApp are among the best places to create private groups to swap photos of your family. Both of the aforementioned apps have end to end encryption, a security protocol that ensures only those in the chats not even the companies can read what is sent. Some privacy experts are wary of how Facebook will monetize WhatsApp in the future and suggest alternatives such as Signal and Telegram, both of which have self destructing message features. Q: I share photos of my child on a private Instagram account. Is this safe? A: If you re sharing photos of your child on Instagram, double check that your account is private by going to Settings Privacy and Security Account Privacy. Sometimes people think they re sharing privately but aren t. Also, comb through your follower list to make sure you trust the people who will see your photos. Even then, you should be cautious when posting about your child. My recent column includes tips such as never posting nude photos, even cute bathtime shots, and always thinking about whether your kid will be embarrassed by a photo years later.

View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, central banks adjust to growth concerns, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is sentenced, and the White House explores requiring health care providers to disclose prices. 1. Slow growth spurred central banks to shift tacks. The ECB unveiled surprise plans to stimulate the eurozone s flagging economy, while Fed officials signaled growing reluctance to raise U.S. interest rates. Less than three months after it ended a $2.9 trillion bond buying program, the ECB said it would hold rates at current levels at least through the year end months longer than it previously signaled and that it would issue a fresh batch of cheap long term loans for banks starting in September. Fed governor Lael Brainard said a slowing global economy, risks to U.S. growth and uncertainty support the case for fewer rate increases than she previously expected, in a major change to her outlook. Global stocks slid on renewed concerns about the health of the world economy, with Chinese shares suffering their worst day in five months as exports slumped. Yet the U.S. bull market will turn 10 years old on Saturday. These six charts tell the story of the stock market rally. Follow the story: Subscribe to our Markets and Real Time Economics newsletters, and visit WSJ.com today for updates. 2. Paul Manafort is sentenced to 47 months in prison for tax evasion and bank fraud. WSJ s Shelby Holliday recaps Paul Manafort s charges and how the trial unfolded. PHOTO: AP U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis ordered a sentence for President Trump s former campaign chairman that was significantly shorter than the 19 24 years prosecutors urged, saying their guidelines were out of whack. Mr. Manafort read a statement in which he said the past two years had been the most difficult of his life and the public s perception of him wasn t one he recognized. I was surprised I did not hear you express regret. Judge Ellis on Mr. Manafort s statement Mr. Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced next week in a separate case in which he pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct justice. 3. The White House weighs mandating disclosure of medical rates. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is seeking public comment on whether patients, before receiving care, have a right to see the secret prices that hospitals, doctors and other health care providers charge insurers for services. It is a major step toward a possible rule that could require providers which would potentially face fines for noncompliance to release such information, giving patients more decision making power that could ultimately lead to lower copays or deductibles. From reporter Stephanie Armour: Senior Trump administration officials said they want patients to be able to price shop for treatments the way they may shop for a car. Expect stiff opposition and lawsuits if this leads to a final rule. But it s the boldest move yet by the White House to show it is serious about price transparency in health care. The hope is that consumers who know prices will shop around, spurring competition that drives down cost. stephanie.armour wsj.com 4. Martin Shkreli works on a second act. The disgraced pharmaceutical executive is 16 months into a seven year sentence for securities fraud, but he remains the shadow power of Phoenixus, the drug company that came under fire for raising the prices of rare medications under its former name, Turing Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Shkreli believes Phoenixus could be worth $3.7 billion by the time he is due to leave prison in 2023. But his continued involvement in the company could pose problems, with the FBI interviewing associates about his role there. And minority shareholders want to limit Mr. Shkreli s influence so Phoenixus can be sold. Advertisement LEAVE THIS BOX EMPTY Share this email with a friend. Forward Forwarded this email by a friend?

The Journal worked with Moody s Analytics to rank labor markets in 377 metro areas across the country, using five metrics: unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, job growth, labor force growth and wage growth. See how your metro area stacks up. The Trump administration proposed a rule that would expand overtime coverage by boosting the annual salary threshold that generally determines who qualifies for overtime pay to $35,308 from $23,660. 1.3 million The number of Americans who would become newly eligible for overtime pay under the Labor Department proposal The proposed rule, which is open for public comment and could take months to be finalized, left many employers relieved, in part because it sets the salary threshold lower than the $47,476 that President Obama hoped to implement. 6. What We re Following Deal or No Deal: The U.S. and China haven t set a date for a summit to resolve their trade dispute, the U.S. ambassador to China said, as neither side feels an agreement is imminent. Cash Is King: Philadelphia, seeking to keep the marketplace open to people without credit, became the first major U.S. city to ban cashless stores. Bad Breakup: Edward Lampert s new Sears is already facing legal troubles with the old company left behind in bankruptcy and with Stanley Black Decker over the Craftsman brand name. 7.

Bloomberg The SEC is scrutinizing the multitiered pricing system used by stock exchanges to see if they favor large brokers. Reuters 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about Facebook s plan to emphasize private communications and small group chats: Elton Saulsberry, Georgia The only way to fix Facebook is for the company to shift to a subscription model and eliminate advertising. As long as the user is the product, not the customer, Facebook will continue selling the user. Chris Harris, Colorado I agree with Mr. Zuckerberg s acknowledgment of big trade offs between safety and privacy regarding encrypted messaging. Something has to be done to combat such concerns. However, I am curious about what patterns of activity and other signals to identify and stop bad actors can be used if Mr. Zuckerberg claims this service is totally private. D. Greene, North Carolina This may be a great business decision because it s what we seem to be asking for and what the world truly doesn t need : more opportunity to reinforce our confirmation biases, wall off differing opinions and further entrench our pre existing viewpoints.

Click here Hey Zixuan Welcome to your first lesson in the WSO Modeling Series! What I wished someone told me when I first entered investment banking is that everyone will be lost for a while... confused about what they are actually supposed to do. It is during this time that you can set yourself apart by learning a few key Excel secrets. The real truth is that you become a rock star analyst not by being a rainmaker but by knowing the technical material down pat including the Excel stuff . Secret 1: If you master some key Excel shortcuts, you will be faster and look smarter. I strongly suggest that you print out this Excel shortcuts file and have it posted in front of you in your cubicle. Below are some key Excel shortcuts that you should memorize but there are many many more to learn before you are a true master : Control C Copy Alt E S Paste special Shift arrow keys Select cells Control 1 Format box Alt H O I Autofit columns Control spacebar Select an entire column Shift spacebar Select an entire row Control Show formulas F9 Recalculate workbooks Alt .... Autosum F2 Open a cell without using your mouse Shift F2 Insert a comment In time, you will discover a simple truth: using the keyboard is MUCH quicker than using the mouse once you become comfortable using Excel shortcuts. In investment banking and private equity the work load never really dies down. You are often given assignments and a deadline and if you get these assignments done before the deadline then you get some downtime much needed, might I add to check ESPN or get a quick workout in when the MDs / VPs leave. Excel shortcuts are so important because of the seconds they shave off of assignments. Seconds add up to minutes which add up to hours. Imagine getting out at 12am as opposed to 2am every night. Not using your mouse and learning Excel shortcuts can make that much of a difference. Now, you may be wondering, well, thanks Patrick, but how do I get quick at such Excel shortcuts? The truth: practice! Stop using your mouse! Practice makes perfect. Start internalizing the Excel shortcuts and you will find yourself using the keyboard more than the mouse. But, you have to get some self control and work through the pain of memorizing and applying the shortcuts before you experience the glory. Here is a quick excel formatting exercise I have put together to test your Excel skills: click here to download the excel file. I CHALLENGE you to complete this Excel quiz in under 2 minutes...or if you are really good, you may be able to get it to under 1 minute like our Excel master in this video. If you create a video and post it to this thread on WSO, we have a free WSO t shirt with your name on it IF you have the fastest time. Every month we'll be sending out a free WSO t shirt to the fastest recorded time. Good luck! Stay tuned, because in the next few lessons we're going to show you some of the most crucial concepts you need to know to become a financial modeling master...

Click here Hi Zixuan Patrick here from Wall Street Oasis with your third tip in the WSO Networking Series... So you're working to build up your network, possibly even using one of the templates I sent you last week. You've reached out to a few key people, and then THIS hits your inbox: Sure, sounds great, I can meet for a drink tomorrow at 6pm. Does that work for you? GULP! Don't panic this is where the informational interview happens... The informational interview is an informal meeting to learn more about a specific industry, firm, career or position. These interviews can be extremely valuable, because if you make a good impression on your contact, they will most likely vouch for you in the recruiting process which means your odds of landing the job go up IMMENSELY. So how do you help make that happen? Here are 3 CRITICAL STEPS to get you ready: 1. Over Dress. Look professional and wear business formal attire, showing them you appreciate their time and respect them. If they will be wearing casual attire, then business casual should be fine. 2. Study Their Bio Firm and Have 10 DETAILED Questions Prepared. Too many candidates get lazy and ask generic questions. You want to ask focused, pertinent questions to show you've done your homework our WSO Search Function can help with this . 3. Calibrate Your Demeanor to Theirs. Are they relaxed and joking around? Serious and sober? If possible, you should mirror their attitude while always staying slightly more formal than them. And don't forget to SMILE and RELAX. These are people too, just like you! That's it for the dos . Now here's a few don'ts ... 1. Don't Try to Sound Smart. If you start talking like you're a phD in macroeconomics, you will likely come across as weak or worse, annoying. Not a good impression. And why are you speaking so much anyway? 2. Don't Forget to Build a Human Connection. If you can take the conversation off to a mutual interest sports, travel, hobby, etc , this can be a great way to build a stronger bond with a potential mentor. The key here is to take their lead. 3. Don't Whip Out Your Resume unless specifically asked . If they do ask, have them take a look and ask for suggestions on improvement. Later that day, make the changes and send them a revised version, thanking them again . 4. Don't Be Late. This shows a lack of respect and your odds of getting an interview plummet. Why? You just demonstrated that you are not reliable. Show up 30 minutes early and review your questions. 5. Don't Forget to Follow Up. Start with a thank you e mail sent that same day with something specific that they helped you with. Additionally, follow up once every 4 6 weeks to keep them updated on your job search. Follow these guidelines and you should nail your informational interviews every time... Stay tuned...in just 5 more days I'll give you 10 of the best sample questions to ask that will help leave a great impression. Stay Strong!

Click here Hi Zixuan, Patrick from WSO with the last lesson in our WSO Financial Modeling Series.... In today's free lesson, we'll go through a simple leveraged buyout LBO model. This is the primary deal structure most private equity firms use to purchase companies. In our prior lessons we learned how to become more reliant on the keyboard in Excel, how to build a DCF model, how to build a comparable comps analysis and how to link up a cash flow statement to an income statement and a balance sheet. Along with today's LBO lesson, these make up the foundational skills of an investment banker. It is also no coincidence that these topics come up time and again in investment banking interviews. Today, we'll break the lesson up into 3 sections: 1. LBO intuition: How an LBO is almost exactly like buying a house 2. Concept Checker: A simple LBO drill 3. Building a simple LBO Model If you are already comfortable with the intuition of an LBO, you can jump straight to section 3... If section 3 is too easy, consider taking advantage of our special deal for WSO members with Wall Street Prep's Premium Package, which contains a complete actual, true to life LBO model that is used at investment banks . SECTION 1: LBO INTUITION ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE BUYING A HOUSE Many of us do an LBO in our own lives without even realizing it when we buy a house. Let's say you are thinking about buying a house for $500,000 $80,000 down payment, $420,000 mortgage that will serve you as an investment property. Purchase price assumptions Converting that into investment banking speak, we can define the terms in the simple house purchase described above as follows: Enterprise value transaction value Value of the entire property $500,000 Net debt $420,000 mortgage. Equity value $80,000 down payment Another way to think about the equity value is to think of it as the residual value after all non equity claims in this case, just the $420,000 loan are paid off. Exit Assumptions In order to determine whether this investment property is worth purchasing, you have to make some assumptions about what rental income down the road will look like, as well as how much you think you might be able to sell the house for at some point in the future. Accordingly, let's say you assume the following: 5 years from now you could sell the house for $550,000 5 years from now, the mortgage you're carrying on the property will decline from $420,000 to $200,000 as cash flows generated through the asset's operations rental income will be sufficient to not only pay interest but to pay down debt principal. Note: With a typical mortgage, it takes 30 years to pay down the mortgage, but with an LBO, debt repayments are typically more aggressive 3 7 years and accomplished through cost cutting and selling off portions of the business. This implies that you believe the equity value of the property will increase from the original $80,000 down payment to $350,000 $550,000 $200,000 at exit. Remember, the equity value of your home is the residual value after all non equity claims are paid off. Typical Private Equity Firm Exits As a property owner your options to monetize your investment are limited to selling the property. Of course, this is just a simple example private equity investors the guys doing actual LBOs , on the other hand, can typically monetize their profits by selling the target to another buyer, selling to the public in an IPO, or recapitalizing the business involves borrowing money again from the banks, which levers up the balance sheet again, and pocketing the proceeds through a dividend. SECTION 2: CONCEPT CHECKER A SIMPLE LBO DRILL With some of the basic intuition laid out in the discussion above, let's begin our simple LBO example.: It is 2009, and a group of financial sponsors are contemplating taking CVS private. The financial sponsors believe that under investor pressure, CVS' management is under pressure to open too many stores, is spreading itself thin, and is hesitant to slash prices to compete effectively with cheaper drugstores because they'll miss EPS estimates in the short term.Taking CVS private would entail that the company undergo a recapitalization to an initially highly levered capital structure. We have identified some pre deal information and made some transaction and exit year assumptions as follows: Here are some questions to see if you're following along....the answers and comments are at the bottom of the e mail but make sure you try to do them yourself before looking! 1 What is CVS' assumed purchase price transaction value in the exit year? 2 What is CVS' implied equity value at the exit year? 3 What is the maximum initial equity contribution by the sponsors? 4 What is the maximum initial transaction value? 5 What is the highest purchase price the sponsors would be willing to pay for each of CVS' shares today? 6 Given CVS' market trading level, is an LBO possible under these assumptions? SECTION 3: BUILDING A SIMPLE LBO MODEL With the LBO drill under your belt, download this LBO model template and then watch this LBO video series and see if you can follow along and build a simple LBO model! Stay tuned, 5 more days until your next lesson! Good Luck! Patrick Curtis Chief Monkey Founder, WallStreetOasis.com ps If you want to become a real modeling master, remember WSO members that are going through this video series get a special deal $100 off premium package the self steady packages from Wall Street Prep...check it out here. pps Answers to Section 2 below: 1. $120.0b ...Our assumption of $15b in EBITDA and an exit multiple of 8.0x implies a price of $120b at exit. 2. $116.0b ... With a debt burden of $4b at exit, equity value at exit is $120b less the outstanding debt. 3. $55.9b ... Since sponsors expect $116b in equity at exit, they'd be willing to put in no more than $55.9b at the initial deal date given their 20% required annualized return. Formula: $116/ 1 20% ^4. 4. $93.4b ... Lenders are willing to lend no more than $37.5b sponsors are willing to invest no more than $55.9b. As a result, no more than $93.4b is available to pay the pre deal lenders and shareholders. 5. $55.63 ... Of the $93.4b in funds available to LBO CVS, $10b goes to pay off pre deal CVS debt, while the remaining $83.4 is used to buy the 1.5b CVS shares outstanding. Formula: $83.4/1.5 $55.63/share. 6. Yes ... Current CVS shares trade for $30 $55.63 represents a substantial premium.

Click here Hi Zixuan, Today we are going to review one of the most common tools used in investment banking...comps! There are also precedent transaction comps, but today we will just focus on Trading Comps so the lesson doesn't get too long. Trading Comps Modeling In today's lesson, we're going to build the single most common model in investment banking: The trading comparables comps model. The comps model is at once the most ubiquitous and the most straight forward model you'll likely be asked to build. Before building an operating model, an M A model, an LBO model, or even a DCF model, you'll be building comps models. So let's get started. We are going to divide the lesson into two parts: 1. Concept checker: A simple comps exercise 2. Review an actual comps model CONCEPT CHECKER: A SIMPLE COMPS EXERCISE The purpose of a trading comps analysis is to determine what is the appropriate value of a company, based on the market values of operationally similar companies. When you try to gauge the fair value of your house by comparing to the values of houses nearby, you're doing a comps analysis. Now companies are of course a little trickier... for one to standardize for size differences across similar companies, we don't compare absolute values but rather values are standardized against a measure of the firm's profitability multiples . Some of the most common multiples are: Enterprise Value EV / EBITDA EV / Revenue EV / EBIT PE ratio Share price / EPS Market cap / Net income Exercise: Fill in the blanks of this simple exercise to make sure you understand the basic concepts before diving into the model: SOLUTION: It should be obvious that at $30 per share, Company A is approximately 25 30% undervalued when compared to our comps derived share price. Remember, like the DCF and all other forms of valuation, final results should be presented using a range of possibilities. For example, in this analysis, it may be appropriate to use a sales multiple range of 1.2x 1.6x, EBITDA multiple range of 6.0x 7.0x, and a P/E multiple range of 16.0x 17.0x We used some of the most common multiples EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and P/E to determine Colgate's value. Depending on the industry, alternative multiples may be used in this analysis when appropriate such as Price/Book, Enterprise Value/EBIT, and others REVIEWING AN ACTUAL COMPS MODEL In this two part video, we're going to walk through a simplified investment banking comps model.

Click here Hi Zixuan, Today's modeling lesson will be on building an accretion / dilution analysis. This may sound boring, but it's one of the key ways an acquisition is justified and viewed by the financial markets. How does Company A's earning per share compare to the the combined earnings per share when/if it buys Company B? That is the main question we are trying to answer here. Accretion / Dilution One of the core models investment banking analysts and associates have to build when analyzing an acquisition is the accretion/dilution model. Again, the underlying purpose of such an analysis is to assess the impact of an acquisition on the acquirer's expected future earnings per share EPS . Broadly speaking, acquirers can pay for their acquisition by: 1 Exchanging acquirer shares in a 100% stock deal 2 By paying cash in a 100% cash deal 3 By using a combination of both forms of consideration for example 50% stock 50% cash In a 100% stock deal, the major adjustment to the acquirer's EPS will come from the fact that the acquirer must issue a lot of new acquirer stock in exchange for target shares. Contrast this with a 100% cash deal, where no new acquirer shares must be issued, but excess cash reserves must be used or the acquirer must take on new debt to finance the acquisition. An acquisition is accretive when the combined pro forma EPS is greater than the acquirer's standalone EPS. For example, suppose analysts expect Procter Gamble's EPS to be $3.05 next year. You are a banker charged with the task of modeling the impact to Procter Gamble's EPS if they were to acquire Colgate Palmolive. So you build your model and determine that the combined/pro forma EPS PF EPS next year would actually be $3.10... or $0.05 higher than had the acquisition not taken place. In other words, the deal would be $0.05 accretive next year. An acquisition is dilutive if the opposite is determined: that PF EPS would be lower than $3.05 A deal is considered breakeven when there is no projected impact to the EPS. Accretion: When PF EPS Acquirer's EPS Dilution: When PF EPS Acquirer's EPS Breakeven: No impact on Acquirer's EPS Now that we got definitions out of the way, let's dive into the mechanics of a very basic accretion/dilution analysis assuming a 100% STOCK TRANSACTION: Step 1: You will need to gather the following inputs and assumptions: The offer price per share and the total number of target shares outstanding The acquirer share price and the total number of acquirer shares outstanding The target's projected net income and EPS The acquirer's projected net income and EPS Step 2: Combine the acquirer and target's net incomes. The result is called pro forma net income PFNI and will be the numerator in the new PF EPS. Step 3: Next, we turn to calculating the denominator in the new PF EPS. This is the slightly tricky part, as we cannot simply add up the target and acquirer shares outstanding. Since the acquirer is buying target stock using acquirer's own stock not cash , the acquirer will need to calculate how many new acquirer shares will need to be issued to target shareholders in exchange for the target shares, and then add this number to the current acquirer share count: 1. Calculate the offer value offer price per share x number of target shares outstanding. 2. Acquirer shares to be issued in the transaction offer value / acquirer share price 3. Pro forma shares outstanding PFSO Acquirer shares Step 4: Divide the PFNI by the PFSO and compare to the acquirer's standalone EPS to determine accretion dilution. PF EPS Acquirer's EPS ... Deal is accretive PF EPS Acquirer's EPS ... Deal is dilutive PF EPS Acquirer's EPS ... Deal is breakeven Adjustments to PFNI Before we just lump the two net incomes together, there are several sometimes very significant adjustments to net income that will be used in determining accretion / dilution. New acquirer debt When an acquirer purchases the stock of a target with cash vs. acquirer stock , the acquirer can either fund the acquisition by using excess cash it has sitting in reserve, or by borrowing. This new borrowing impacts the income statement in the form of incremental interest expense, reducing the PFNI and PF EPS. In fact, the major adjustment to EPS in a cash deal is often the incremental interest expense arising from additional debt issued to finance the deal. Cost savings Synergies Often the main rationale of an acquisition is to make a significant cut in expenses by eliminating overlapping R D efforts, closing down manufacturing plants, and employee redundancies. Any forecasted cost savings from the acquisition will reduce expenses and thus increase PFNI and PF EPS. Fees Investment banking advisory fees, legal fees, and accounting fees, which need to be expensed as incurred on the income statement, reducing PFNI and PF EPS. When a company borrows debt to finance an acquisition, the fees related to this borrowing are treated differently from advisory, legal, and accounting fees. Underwriting fees are capitalized and amortized over the life of the debt issuance. This creates an incremental amortization expense which reduces PFNI. Incremental D A, asset write ups, write downs In an acquisition, the target's assets like PP E and intangible assets are written up to fair market value . Incremental D A will be recorded thereby reducing PFNI and PF EPS. Goodwill Any goodwill created in an acquisition no longer impacts the income statement at least not immediately so there is no explicit, systematic impact of goodwill on PFNI or PF EPS. Adjustments to PFSO In a 100% cash deal or a combination cash/stock deal, the number of acquirer shares outstanding will be lower than in a 100% stock deal, and the exact number needs to be calculated based on the fraction of the deal financed with stock. Presentation of Accretion Dilution Analysis Once the accretion / dilution analysis is complete, it is often presented using a data table in Excel. Since the analysis is done before a deal, it is rooted in assumptions like the offer price, the form of consideration, and the interest rate on borrowing. The data table presentation in Excel enables analysts to easily change certain assumptions and to see how those changes affect the accretion/dilution outcome: Ready to Model?? Download the spreadsheet here and complete the exercise good luck! Conclusion This is a brief introduction to the concepts and adjustments underlying accretion/dilution analysis and modeling. These are, of course, just a few of the many issues that come into play when building an accretion/dilution analysis. Other adjustments that we did not include they are typically minor, but may be significant for some transactions involve the treatment of in process research development, registration fees, and refinancing target debt, as well as calendarization challenges in Excel syncing up companies with different fiscal year ends , and adjustments for acquisitions in the middle of the year stub year adjustments .

Click here Hi Zixuan, You knew who they were by the end of your first day on the job. In fact, everyone knew them, and everyone respected them. They were always staffed on the best deals. They always got the highest bonuses. They were the analysts who knew their shit. The guys gals that were technically rock solid they were on the client calls whispering to the senior bankers about the numbers. I wanted to be one of those guys. And a long tough year into my job I was FINALLY one of those guys. Not because I possess any unique skills. Becoming a rockstar analyst is, as it turns out, somewhat straight forward. And it could have been a lot easier if I realized what I needed to do long before my first day on the job. In fact, it probably would have landed me more interviews. It's a secret I wish someone had clued me in on before I started my analyst stint. The truth is, perhaps someone had, but it sounded so mundane that I didn't even realize it when I heard it. I am going to share that secret with you, but I'm going to put in ALL CAPS so that there is no missing it the mundane advice I am about to share with you IS the secret to becoming the rock star analyst. The secret is... UNDERSTANDING THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT IS THE KEY TO BEING A ROCK STAR ANALYST. In case you missed it, I'll bold it: understanding the cash flow statement is the key to being a rock star analyst. THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT CFS The CFS is the glue that connects the financial statement together, and the financial statements are the cornerstone of virtually all investment banking models. Want to build an operating model? Better understand the CFS or you're in for a long night of chasing circular references. Want to build a merger or LBO model? Better make sure the CFS is tight or your model won't balance. The list goes on and on. The CFS is the matrix. By the way, I'll show you how to build an LBO model in the next lesson. : So...In this lesson, you'll see a step by step video where we build a CFS given an income statement and balance sheet in Excel. And I'm going to introduce you to how the CFS is conceptually and mechanically linked to the other statements. At every step of these videos, ask yourself, could I explain in layman's terms why this line item is calculated this way. Then open up this template and try to build it yourself. HOW IS THE CFS LINKED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT AND BALANCE SHEET THE INTERVIEW ANSWER Before diving into the lesson, let's think about the CFS linkage to the income statement and balance sheet from a 30,000 foot view: The last line on the income statement is net income. Net income links to both the balance sheet and cash flow statement. How? On the balance sheet, net income flows into stockholder's equity via retained earnings. Retained earnings is equal to the previous period's retained earnings plus net income from this period less dividends from this period. On the CFS, net income is the first line as it is used to calculate cash flows from operations. Also, any non cash expenses or non cash income from the income statement i.e., depreciation and amortization flow into the cash flow statement and adjust net income to arrive at cash flow from operations. Any balance sheet items that have a cash impact i.e., working capital, financing, PP E, etc. are linked to the cash flow statement since it is either a source or use of cash. The net change in cash on the cash flow statement and cash from the previous period's balance sheet comprise cash for this period. That explanation, while a perfect and concise answer to an interview question, only scratches the surface of the true connections. Every transaction, every expense, income items, asset, liability, or equity item, has its own considerations and its own cash flow implications. So let's get your feet wet: BUILDING A CASH FLOW MODEL IN EXCEL The accounting in this exercise is a simplified presentation of how the three major financial statements are inter related and lays the foundation of financial statement models in investment banking. If you'd like to get even more advanced and prepared, definitely take a look at this special deal that can get you $100 off of Wall Street Prep's premium financial modeling package only for WSO members that are in this modeling series and expires 24hrs after the last lesson .

Click here Zixuan, Patrick here from Wall Street Oasis. For our second lesson, we are going to go over a discounted cash flow model DCF . If you get stuck at any part, I included links to our finance dictionary on WSO so you can read more in depth if needed. The DCF is the most widely used valuation methodology in finance. It gives you an estimate of the intrinsic value of an entity given a set of assumptions that drive future cash flows . Many financial professionals compare the DCF value per share to the market value per share to determine if the company is undervalued or overvalued and then make trading decisions based on such information. Step 1: What kind of cash flows will you be discounting unlevered or levered free cash flows? Are these enterprise value before debt payments or equity value after debt payments FCFs? Discounting unlevered FCFs will yield the enterprise value, while discounting levered cash flows will yield equity value. It's pretty easy to get from equity value to enterprise value and vice versa, so both approaches theoretically get you to the same result, but in reality the majority of the DCFs you'll create on the Street unless you work in the FIG group will be unlevered DCFs, so that's what we'll use in our example. Step 2: Figure out how many stages you want your DCF to be. Most practitioners who value mature companies use a two stage DCF model. In stage 1, you forecast cash flows explicitly for a certain period of time usually 5 10 years and in stage 2 you will need to calculate the terminal value. Let's assume a two stage DCF again, most prevalent model . Step 3: For stage 1, figure out how many years you want the explicit forecasted period to be. Typically, 5 10 years is an accepted range. Step 4: Discount the stage 1 cash flows by an appropriate discount rate that reflects the riskiness of the capital. For unlevered DCF, use WACC as the discount rate... for a levered DCF, use cost of equity as the discount rate. Step 5: Calculate stage 2 FCF using growth in perpetuity method or exit EBITDA multiple method. Step 6: Discount stage 2 back to the present. Step 7: Since we are doing an enterprise value DCF, the enterprise value is the sum of stage 1 stage 2 discounted cash flows. See if you can use excel and the steps above to try to find the DCF value / share with the following assumptions: Growth Rate explicit and perpetual : 5.0% Discount Rate/WACC: 10% Number of Diluted Shares: 10,000 Year 1 Cash Flow $2,134 Use the Perpetuity Method Project Cash Flow for 5 Years To check your work you can download the excel file here. Stay tuned because in 5 more days we'll have lesson 3 that walks you through an accretion / dilution analysis. Good luck!

This is William, I am glad to call you and know each other yesterday. I have checked my situation from Stevens and the officer told me that although I have gotten SSN, the application of CPT in this semester has expired on Feb 10th. So, there may be no chance for me to apply for your Spring Analytics Intern. Anyhow, according to my research on your website and other information I got from your former intern, Aditya Gade, I am sure your product and work are appealing to me. Aditya also told me about his positive experience and what he had learned from this intern experience. So, if possible, I will grab the opportunity to apply for your Summer Analytics Intern and please consider me in April. I attached my updated resume for your consideration.

I am very excited about the learning journey we ll have together in this Spring semester. I m also hoping this journey will be a fun and useful experience for you. To prepare for our first class, I have a few action items for you: Please read the Syllabus published on Canvas carefully to make sure the course fits with your learning plan Prepare for a Python environment since we will have many hands on lessons using Python. I would like to recommend you to install Anaconda, a free, easy to install Python environment along with GUI editors and many libraries. If you are new to Python, here is the detailed installation instruction: Download Anaconda at https://www.anaconda.com/download Install Anaconda following instruction https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ at for windows or macOS Pick Jupyter Notebook or Spyder as your python GUI editor. Launch any of the editors from Anaconda Navigator , which you should have after installing Anaconda. Note that all lecture notes will be published as Jupyter Notebook files. Optional After installation, open a terminal for Mac or Anaconda command window for Windows to update all python libraries using: conda update all Please make sure you have the python environment before the first class, since we'll start the Python module in the first class. Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions about the tasks. As stated in the syllabus, this is not an introductory course of Python programming. Instead, natural language processing NLP and text mining are the focus of this course along with extensive hands on exercises using Python. If you haven't programmed with Python, you'll need to take extra effort to master python programming in order to keep up with the course progress. There are a number of online sources you can use to boost your Python programming skills. I recommend the following: Introduction to Data Science in Python from Coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/python data analysis. I highly recommend this course for those who'd like to pursue the data science career. Unfortunately, this is a paid course, but you can audit it for free. Also, there are many free online tutorials for beginners: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/ https://www.learnpython.org/ https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python pandas/ for Pandas We'll spend three lessons on Python to give your a quick review of Python fundamentals. It is not realistic to expect a beginner to become a master in Python through three lessons. If you are new to Python, please be sure to take extra effort and use additional materials to bring your Python programming to at least an intermediate level within a few weeks. Look forward to meeting with all of you next week! Emily Liu Associate Professor View announcement Update your notification settings ...

Hi Zixuan Patrick here from Wall Street Oasis, with your next tip for networking more effectively... Last week we talked about the informational interview, and how asking extremely detailed questions were a key to leaving a great impression. This is where a lot of people usually get stumped, because they don't want to sound rehearsed or too smart . So here's 10 great sample questions to ask, and the situations where to use them: When Meeting with Junior Investment Bankers: Sample 1 to an M A Analyst / Associate: What percentage of the work you do has been pitching versus actual transactions and what level of exposure have the teams given you to the model? Sample 2 to a Restructuring Analyst / Associate: I recently saw that your restructuring group was retained for the XYZ bankruptcy. I assume that was on the debtor side since that is typically the engagements your group works on? Have you done any creditor work and which did you like better? I'm trying to get a feel for what the difference is between debtor and creditor side work. Sample 3 to an Analyst / Associate in a Specific Industry Group: I saw the recent transaction your group completed with XYZ firm. Who provided the financing for the deal and how frequently does your group bring in outside banks or provide staple financing? When Meeting with Junior Private Equity Professionals: Sample 4 to pre MBA Associate: How much of your time is spent monitoring portfolio companies versus due diligence on new deals? Sample 5 to pre MBA Associate: How much dry powder is left in the current fund and how is fundraising going for the current fund? Are there any commitments yet? Sample 6 to pre MBA Associates: Do they allow you to co invest in deals? I assume there is no carry for pre MBA associates? When Meeting with Junior Hedge Fund Professionals: Sample 7 to a Special Situations/event Driven Equities Group: How does the work flow/responsibilities change over time as you move up and how does the buy process work? Sample 8 to a HF Analyst from WSO : What do you think is the best way for someone to master the basics on their own, or to at least learn enough to get into a fund post MBA? I've spoken with an analyst at a large HF who directed me to do the following: 1. Read as much as possible: news, filings, industry research, investment/strategy books, etc. 2. Develop a one or two really good in depth ideas into full pitches 3. Invest in your PA. Does this sound like the right approach or would you add anything to that list? When Meeting with Junior Sales Trading Professionals: Sample 9 to an Emerging Markets Trader: I understand that emerging markets traders can cover many products and focus on 1 4 countries in which they make markets, or they can trade 1 2 products and cover many countries. My question, however, is if equities are under EM at your desk or a general equities umbrella? Sample 10 to Junior Trader: I have been studying up on leverage inherent in futures and created a risk management plan for my own PA...ie how I size trades, use stops, add to positions, etc. Do you think there are other specific ways I can prepare for interviews to show that I'm genuinely interested in trading? REMEMBER, these are JUST samples. Feel free to tweak and modify to make them your own. On the other end of the spectrum, here's 3 questions you should almost never ask, especially when you're first getting to know someone: How much do you get paid? or any variation What are your hours? Do you like your job? See a difference? The first 10 samples are all very specific and demonstrate a certain level of knowledge. You've done your research and are genuinely interested. The last three are just plain LAZY and you'll get lazy answers in response. That's it for now. But keep an eye out... because in our final e mail in 2 days, we'll be revealing our secret weapon to help you continue your journey to networking mastery. Stay Strong!

View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, President Trump says the Mueller report exonerates him, a test of Boeing s influence in Washington, and a big bet for Apple. 1. Special counsel Robert Mueller didn t find that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller walked near the White House after attending church Sunday in Washington. PHOTO: CLIFF OWEN/ASSOCIATED PRESS The special counsel didn t establish that President Trump and his campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, according to a letter Attorney General William Barr sent to Congress yesterday that summarized the final report on the Mueller investigation. Mr. Mueller didn t draw a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Mr. Barr wrote, noting the report neither found that the president committed a crime nor exonerated him. In the absence of a determination from Mr. Mueller, Mr. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Mr. Trump s actions didn t reach the bar of a crime. The president described the investigation as an illegal takedown that failed, but said its findings were a complete and total exoneration of him and his campaign. The news sparked a fresh battle on Capitol Hill. Democrats said they would proceed with probes of the Trump administration, while Republicans said their opponents should desist. Read highlights from the attorney general s summary of the Mueller report. The investigation caps a long career in public service for the special counsel. 2. Congressional scrutiny of Boeing is shaping up as a test of the aircraft maker s influence in Washington. For years, Boeing and its lobbyists pushed to reduce the time it takes to get a new plane certified to fly, and Congress and the FAA both targets of the company s multimillion dollar lobbying supported efforts to delegate some safety certification functions to the plane maker. Now, after two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 MAX airplanes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, lawmakers are questioning whether a new automated antistall system in the aircraft was properly vetted. Boeing says there were no shortcuts in approvals for the 737 MAX. From reporter Ted Mann: Boeing has one of the biggest and most aggressive lobbying operations in Washington, and it has been successful in convincing lawmakers of both parties to embrace efforts to streamline the process of approving new airplanes. In the wake of these crashes, Boeing will be playing defense, as Congress questions whether it has let safety certification shift too far in the company s direction. Boeing is well positioned for a big test of what companies call government relations, or GR. As one executive from another major company puts it: Boeing is a corporation where intersections between government and company are legion. The whole company is a GR team. ted.mann wsj.com 3. With the iPhone running out of juice, Apple pivots to TV and news. Apple CEO Tim Cook last year in Chicago. PHOTO: JIM YOUNG/AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES To go beyond the device that made Apple a global colossus, Tim Cook is betting on services marking the company s biggest shift in more than a decade. Years in the making, the chief executive s strategy takes Apple out of its comfort zone into an area filled with risks and competition. From reporter Tripp Mickle: It s showtime for Apple. The iPhone is sputtering and pressure is mounting for CEO Tim Cook to find new avenues of growth. His plan will take a step forward at today s event, where Apple is expected to unveil video and news subscription services designed to deliver billions of dollars in revenue growth. tripp.mickle wsj.com 4. As political scrutiny mounts, drugmaker Eli Lilly divulges new insulin pricing data. Lilly says the price it was paid for its widely used Humalog insulin dropped by 8.1% during the previous five years after accounting for rebates and discounts, to an average of $135 a month. During the same period, the average list price rose 52% to $594 a month. The rising cost of diabetes treatments has figured prominently in broader discussion of drug prices. Meanwhile, disappointing results for Alzheimer s drugs targeting Beta amyloid buildup in the brain have renewed focus on drugs for the disease that act in other ways.

The Federal Housing Administration, concerned it is allowing too many risky loans to be extended, is tightening its standards. The agency told lenders this month it would begin flagging more loans as high risk, and that those mortgages will go through a more rigorous manual underwriting process a decision that could mean fewer first time home buyers are able to get mortgages. Roughly 40,000 to 50,000 loans a year likely would be affected, or about 4% to 5% of the FHA insured mortgages originated annually in recent years. 6. Venezuela has an anti American, socialist government but the country increasingly relies on a potent symbol of American capitalism, the U.S. dollar. The trend has led to growing inequality between Venezuelans with dollars and those stuck with the local currency, the bolivar. The U.S. currency is flooding into the country from overseas as rising numbers of migrants send back money, or remittances, to their remaining family members. The differences between those who receive remittances and those who don t are widening by the minute, and prices keep on climbing. I can t even afford my children s meals. A 12 hour workday for me is worth 3 pounds of cheese. Jackson de vila, a Caracas security guard who is paid in bolivars 7.

Bloomberg Two Russian air force planes landed in Venezuela on Saturday carrying nearly 100 troops. Reuters 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about President Trump s endorsement of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights: Anne Etra, New York No one knows better than Israel the strategic value of the Golan Heights and the enemies that lurk on all sides. Good for Trump for stating the obvious, and not asking the world s permission. It tells the world that the U.S. Israel bond is solid, strong and serious. Cynthia Lessick, New Jersey Israel has been in de facto control of the Golan Heights for decades, effectively preventing both a hostile invasion from the north and the spreading of the internecine Arab conflicts plaguing the Middle East into Israel. While I wish the media would give more attention to the medical and humanitarian aid Israel routinely gives to victims of the Syrian war and others from the surrounding hostile nations and territories, I oppose President Trump s unilateral declaration regarding Israeli authority. America should lead in persuading the world as to why it makes good sense regionally to support Israeli control over the Golan Heights. Unilateral imposition of territorial rights generally leads to further conflict. At a minimum, America should be advocating for an internationally patrolled and secure demilitarized zone in the Golan that allows for high ground observation posts to facilitate the security of Israel and stabilization of the region. Phil Strause, California A needless, politically motivated recognition of reality. For practical purposes, Israel s annexation of the Golan has been a nonissue for years. Israel neither would, nor should, give up the Golan Heights. This tweet potentially stirs things up with no benefit for anyone other than Netanyahu. Dale McConnaughay, Michigan At last, a sharp turn in the so called peace process that might actually work, or at least prove more peaceful than bloody.

Hey Data Scientists, This week we have a special episode for you! We focused on the career development with seasoned executive Luis Blanco, Vice President of Product Compliance and Strategy at Ellie Mae. As the former Director of Risk Operations at American Express, Luis played a crucial role in launching and developing the predictive models that are the foundation of today s data science space. Instead of thinking about jobs, I tend to think about skills I want to learn and then find jobs that match those skills. Luis Blanco You can also hear Luis Blanco talking about different ways to advance your data science career at DataScienceGO 2019. Tune into this week s podcast to hear how Luis Blanco s career evolved in tandem with the data industry at large. Much of the knowledge that budding data scientists now know to pursue was brought into existence by Luis and his team in the early 2000s. The story of how he pioneered his own data driven path is one that will inspire any data enthusiast. One of the models I implemented was the equivalent of decision trees today, but on older technology, most of the challenge was being able to run the data through our machines.

Did you know that Survival Analysis is used in many fields ranging from engineering to insurance, medical research or even marketing? Did you know that R is extremely popular in survival analysis? Do you want to know the best R packages for survival analysis? Do you want to get a comprehensive hands on training on survival analysis? Well, if your answer was YES to some of these questions, you do not need to look any further. The new Survival Analysis in R course is now live on Udemy. 4 hours of video content including the script, 6 course chapters and several exercises will get you ready in no time. Survival Analysis is a sub discipline of statistics. It actually has several names. In some fields it is called event time analysis, reliability analysis or duration analysis. R is one of the main tools to perform this sort of analysis thanks to the survival package. Course Structure: We will start out with course orientation, background on which packages are primarily used for survival analysis and how to find them, the course datasets as well as general survival analysis concepts. After that we will dive right in and create our first survival models. We will use the Kaplan Meier estimator as well as the log rank test as our first standard survival analysis tools. When we talk about survival analysis there is one model type which is an absolute cornerstone of survival analysis: the cox proportional hazards model. You will learn how to create such a model, how to add covariates and how to interpret the results. You will also learn about survival trees. These rather new machine learning tools are more and more popular in survival analysis. In R you have several functions available to fit such a survival tree. The last 2 sections of the course are designed to get problematic datasets outliers, missing values, wrong date and time format ready for analysis.

Message clipped View entire message\", \"WSJ Tech Weekly: Facebook's Next Phase Plus: Amazon Go store, the internet's login problems, FaceTime alternative for Android Trouble viewing this email? View in web browser Technology In today s letter: A trip to the Amazon Go store, one possible origin story for Groot, an Android alternative to FaceTime, and videogaming for fun and profit. But first, this guy again ... Credit: Getty Images Facebook surprised the tech world this week by announcing it would focus on private messaging and encryption. The company long synonymous with public sharing and privacy erosion suddenly seemed to do a 180. The platform proposed by Mark Zuckerberg would be a unified messaging service across WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, where the content would be encrypted end to end and disappear over time. Facebook wouldn t be able to read the messages or see any shared pictures, and the likelihood of an embarrassing post coming back to bite a person would diminish dramatically. Praise and criticism immediately followed the announcement. It made business sense, since Facebook is seeing declining use of its core social network but a rise in small group interactions and activity on WhatsApp, which is already encrypted. Analysts drew comparisons to WeChat, China s hugely successful social platform, which wraps a payment system, games and other revenue generating products around a messaging core. But advertisers with little grasp of messaging wondered how they would continue reaching audiences. And people who have long been concerned with Facebook s privacy record doubted Mr. Zuckerberg s words. User behavior could still be carefully monitored and mined to generate ad revenue, even if the message content was invisible to Facebook. If anything, end to end encryption would give Facebook a tidy way out of its current predicament: a rising need to police divisive, fraudulent and otherwise problematic content. While the announcement made big waves, Facebook didn t promise the changes would happen fast. Over the next few years, we plan to rebuild more of our services around these ideas, wrote Mr. Zuckerberg. For a company repeatedly stung by the content appearing in people s news feeds, not to mention data leaks under the hood, a few years for change might be too long a wait.

Got a question of your own? Reply to this email or write to us at personaltech wsj.com. Q: Do Samsung Galaxy devices and other Android phones have an equivalent to Apple s FaceTime? Dan Richards from Ontario, Calif. A: Google s Duo app is the closest thing Android offers to a FaceTime competitor. It s not as seamlessly integrated, and doesn t come preinstalled on most phones, but it does let you quickly make video and voice calls. It also has one distinct advantage: It s relatively platform agnostic. Duo works on Android and iOS, and even on the web. Note: Questions are edited for clarity and length. Mini Review: My Trip to the Amazon Go Store Amazon Go store on California Street in San Francisco. Note the open ceiling with all of the surveillance devices mounted there. Credit: Wilson Rothman/The Wall Street Journal By Joanna Stern There s really only one way to shop at the cashierless Amazon Go store: Put on a show for the hundreds of cameras. Wave your hands at the array in the ceiling, stick your tongue out at the ones hiding in the shelves, say Testing 1, 2, 3 to the microphones in the freezers. Yep, that was me at the newly opened San Francisco store a few weeks ago. Someone needs to make sure the omniscient Amazon knows we know it s watching. For the unfamiliar: Amazon Go stores say goodbye to human cashiers. Instead you download the Amazon Go app, link it to your Amazon account, scan it at a turnstyle upon store entry then just take stuff. The tech built into every corner of the space keeps track of your movements, what you pick up and what you leave with. No checkout, no line. You literally grab and go. Hence the name. For all its creepiness and potentially seismic socio economic effects, the tech is damn impressive. I scanned in myself and my colleague Jake, and we each decided on two items a hearty snack pack and some gum for me, licorice and Milano cookies for Jake. In our 10 minutes in the store, we must have picked up over 20 items, yet five minutes after we left, an itemized receipt hit my phone: $12.36 for only what we carried out. Magic. Next time you re in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco, I suggest visiting the future of retail. Don t forget to smile for all the cameras.

View in web browser Technology In today s letter: Tripp Mickle s look inside Apple s risky shift to services, Bob McMillan s powerful interview with the founder of 8chan, and Bradley Cooper s head on Tom Brady s body. But first ... Can you spot the difference between the 2017 iPad Pro, left, and the 2019 iPad Air? That's a trick question. Credit: Apple Apple, in a rare marketing stunt this week, trickled product announcements out over three days: new iPads that look like old iPads , new iMacs that look like old iMacs and new AirPods that look like old AirPods . Amazon joined in the fun, announcing an all new Kindle that seems a lot like an older Paperwhite . Meanwhile, the one truly new gadget I was expecting, the AirPower wireless charging pad Apple promised in 2017, failed to appear. Welcome to the Age of Incrementalism. The products we rely on every day have reached a point where their designs don t really have to change: screens can t get much better, bezels can t get much thinner, headphone jacks can t get much deader. So now, when there s gadget news, you better get out your magnifying glass and a BS detector, because you ll need em both to tell the teeny tiny updates from the teensy weensy updates. Take the iPads, for instance. The new iPad Mini is identical in design to the old Mini released four years ago! . The smaller tablet s only upgrades are its faster processor and new support for the Apple Pencil but the older one, not the newer one. Apple also announced the new iPad Air, which looks suspiciously like the 2017 iPad Pro, and whose purpose I only really understand after reading David Pierce s latest column explaining the 5,000 iPad models now on sale. On one hand, these updates are great news for us: We don t have to keep buying newer stuff because most of the time it isn t meaningfully better. On the other hand, it requires us to be far more eagle eyed when deciphering marketing jargon, in search of the true meaning of anything labeled new. Good luck out there. Joanna Stern, Personal Tech Columnist Coming Up Monday: Apple Goes Hollywood Tim Cook s solution to save Apple s future is to steer beyond selling devices by pitching an array of services, writes Tripp Mickle.

Mini Review: Samsung Galaxy Buds Earphones Credit: Samsung By David Pierce After months of wearing AirPods, popping Samsung s new Galaxy Buds wireless earbuds into my ears felt jarring. For starters, the $139 Galaxy Buds don t extend halfway down my face like they re melting out of my ears. They re a bit heavier, too, and I feel them much more, since they stick into my ears instead of hanging outside of them. But that s a good thing: The Galaxy Buds cancel out most external noise. All my music comes through deeper and richer than through AirPods. Unfortunately, the Galaxy Buds are also missing what makes the AirPods special: their near flawless ability to connect and stay connected. The Buds are easy enough to pair with Samsung phones through the Galaxy Wearable app, but getting my Buds hooked up to my iPad or laptop took multiple tries and a lot of Googling. Even once I got them working on non Samsung devices, some of the on ear controls, such as volume control or virtual assistant activation, weren t available. The two buds also occasionally get out of sync, so I'll have a slight echo in one ear. And the Galaxy Buds connection could be finicky sometimes, flitting in and out at random. That's true of most truly wireless Bluetooth headphones, of course. The only ones that are really rock solid are the AirPods. If you have a Galaxy phone, the Buds are a solid companion for music and calls. Bonus points if you get them free with your new Galaxy S10. Between the six hour battery and the additional juice in the case, I m able to listen during my commutes all that sound isolation really helps on a loud train or plane and only charge every five days or so. But for all day, out in public, cross device listening, they still can t beat the comfort and connectivity of the AirPods. I m sticking with the little white candy canes.

Message clipped View entire message\", \"The 10-Point: A Guide to the Day's Top News President Trump backs Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights another Facebook privacy snafu Brexit is delayed Trouble viewing this email? View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, a dead end for a potential Alzheimer s drug, President Trump endorses Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and Facebook stumbles again on privacy. 1. Drugmakers Biogen and Eisai said they are ending late stage studies of an experimental drug for Alzheimer s disease after determining it was unlikely to help patients. This setback follows the failure of a number of other drugs also targeting a sticky substance called Beta amyloid, whose buildup in the brain has been thought to play a pivotal role in the disease. Biogen s shares closed down 29%, evaporating about $18 billion in market value. Eisai s shares were down 35%. From reporter Jonathan Rockoff: The failure of aducanumab, a compound that once showed promise, is likely to trigger a reappraisal of the amyloid hypothesis that has driven much recent research, though Biogen and smaller companies are pursuing other potential courses of treatment. There is currently no drug approved to slow the memory robbing disease, which affects more than five million people in the U.S. and tens of millions around the world. jonathan.rockoff wsj.com 2. The U.S. should recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, President Trump declared. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, here with President Trump in Jerusalem in 2017, is expected to visit the White House next week. PHOTO: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS Recognition would mark a sharp shift in the U.S. stance on the disputed territory, seized from Syria during the Six Day War in 1967 and annexed in 1981 over international condemnation. But the Twitter declaration doesn t immediately change U.S. policy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, campaigning for re election under a cloud of corruption allegations, is set to leverage his ties to Mr. Trump with a White House visit next week. But Mr. Trump s sovereignty endorsement risks administration efforts to forge a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians. 3. Facebook disclosed yet another privacy snafu, saying that for years it stored hundreds of millions of user passwords in a format accessible to its employees. Facebook said no passwords were exposed externally and it hadn t found evidence of misuse. If passwords are being stored in the clear, accessible by thousands of employees, one can only imagine how poorly other data is being managed. Deirdre K. Mulligan, associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in data privacy This lapse at Facebook, already under fire for how it collects, stores and deploys user data, attracted more attention than similar stumbles elsewhere. The company will notify affected Facebook, Facebook Lite and Instagram users, but doesn t plan to require password changes. 4. Brexit is officially delayed beyond March 29. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May in Brussels on Thursday. PHOTO: ARIS OIKONOMOU/AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES Deadline looming, European leaders decided to allow U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to postpone her country s departure from the bloc. If the British Parliament approves a withdrawal agreement next week, the EU will extend the deadline to May 22, giving both sides time to approve legislation to implement the deal. But if Parliament again votes no, the U.K. will have only until April 12 to indicate how it wants to take the Brexit process forward meaning a disorderly crash out is still possible.

In Russia s heartland, a lagging economy erodes support for President Vladimir Putin. Nastya Klipova, a single mother, has taken on a second job as a driver in Nizhniy Tagil, Russia. You can barely call this an economy here, she said. PHOTO: ARTHUR BONDAR FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Mr. Putin s approval rating is falling as working class Russians increasingly shoulder the burden of Western sanctions and a government more committed to military adventure than overhauling the civilian economy. This month the country s Statistics Institute stopped publishing a monthly calculation of real incomes after five straight years of decline. To maintain his legitimacy, Mr. Putin is under enormous pressure to reverse the economic tide and boost Russians buying power. A visit to Nizhniy Tagil, a one time bastion of Kremlin loyalty 800 miles east of Moscow, highlights the growing discontent. 8.

Washington Post UPS s next home delivery: a nurse. Reuters 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about President Trump signing an executive order tying federal grants made to colleges and universities to free speech: John Burk, California Seems odd, doesn t it? Tying government grant money to an educational institution to help ensure it honors the open expression of different points of view, when indeed the free speech movement of the 1960s originated on campuses across the country. But back then it was the more liberal point of view against the dominant conservative school and government policies that was being suppressed. Now the oppressed have become the oppressors on campus, where those with conservative and libertarian views are shunned and intimidated. It is now the government s turn to own the free speech movement of the 21st century. Power to the people! Monica Harmon, Texas I find it interesting that Trump wants free speech on campus and is willing to tie federal funds to it, but is muting health care providers in discussing abortion. He only wants free speech if it benefits his position and beliefs. Doug Godesky, Maryland Until we have a centralized, governmentwide grants compliance authority with the direct power to withhold funds, addressing these important nonfinancial violations that often cross agency funding lines simply will not happen. Not because agencies are unwilling to work on compliance, but because their bandwidth is already fully devoted to compliance mandates such as improper payments, fraud and waste, and similar financially focused issues. Steve Lawrence, California While promoting free speech on campus is a worthy goal, is cutting off federal funding the way to achieve it? In many cases professors who have little to do with campus policy will be deprived of funding. Colleges and universities should adopt the Chicago Principles on their own, because it is right and responsible. Students need to learn to absorb contrary and disturbing views, control emotions and sharpen counterarguments. Federal regulation interferes.

Message clipped View entire message', \"The 10-Point: A Guide to the Day's Top News Purdue Pharma settlement Democrats focus on health care Smollett charges dropped Trouble viewing this email? View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, Purdue Pharma s landmark settlement in an opioid case, the Apple Qualcomm fight continues, and the return of exurbs. 1. Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, have agreed to pay $270 million to resolve claims filed by the Oklahoma attorney general that the company helped fuel the opioid crisis. It is the first settlement from more than 1,600 opioid lawsuits facing the OxyContin maker. Municipalities claim aggressive marketing of prescription painkillers by Purdue and others helped trigger widespread drug addiction that has saddled them with financial burdens. The majority of the funds from the Oklahoma settlement will be used to create a national addiction center. From reporter Sara Randazzo: The Oklahoma settlement is not only the first for Purdue in the current round of opioid litigation, but the first from any drugmaker or distributor targeted by the suits. The Sacklers said this deal won t become a financial model for other settlements, so we shouldn t expect $270 million multiplied by the more than 35 states that have sued. But the agreement means Purdue is in resolution mode. sara.randazzo wsj.com 2. The Justice Department set a timetable for the release of the Mueller report. Attorney General William Barr at his home Tuesday in McLean, Va. PHOTO: WIN MCNAMEE/GETTY IMAGES A version of the special counsel s report will be available for Congress and the public within weeks, and there are no plans to provide the White House with a copy first, a Justice Department official said. Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders are signaling a renewed emphasis on health care and other issues over opposition to President Trump. A Trump administration legal request to strike down the Affordable Care Act has unleashed fresh attacks from Democrats and stoked a feud among Republicans. The Democratic controlled House yesterday failed to override the president s veto of a measure to roll back his national emergency declaration over the southern border. 3. A U.S. trade body handed both Apple and Qualcomm victories in a long running patent fight over the licensing of chips for the iPhone. Apple netted the more significant victory. Qualcomm s complaints against Apple to the U.S. International Trade Commission are part of a world spanning legal battle between the companies that could determine how much revenue Apple must share from its most important product at a time of slowing global smartphone sales. From reporter Asa Fitch: To Apple s delight, the ITC ruled it hadn t violated a Qualcomm patent that a judge earlier decided it infringed on. But to Apple s chagrin, an ITC administrative judge made an interim ruling that it violated a different Qualcomm patent, raising the specter of a potential import ban on some iPhones. It isn t very likely that such a ban would take effect: The interim ruling would have to survive a possible review by the ITC s commissioners and by the Trump administration. Tuesday s decisions, however, only widen the fissure between the two companies as they prepare for a trial next month in which Apple accuses Qualcomm of using its dominance in smartphone modem chips to extract unfair royalties. asa.fitch wsj.com 4. U.S. based multinationals warn that the new tax law could put them at a disadvantage globally and reduce their incentive to invest at home. For example, Procter Gamble pays about 18% to 19% of its non U.S. income in foreign taxes. That is high enough that executives thought they would avoid a new U.S. minimum tax designed to prevent companies from shifting profits abroad for lower tax rates. Instead, the company now expects to pay the U.S. $100 million annually because of that minimum tax, raising its tax rate on foreign profits to 21%. Executives say that could hurt P G s ability to compete for acquisitions and encourage it to shift research and headquarters expenses abroad.

The exurbs, the engine of the American housing market, are back. A sign points visitors to new communities in Florence, Ariz. PHOTO: CONOR RALPH FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A decade ago, the sight of new homes under construction in Maricopa, Ariz., an enclave 35 miles from downtown Phoenix, was almost unimaginable. Four in five homeowners were underwater, their outstanding mortgages exceeding the value of their properties. Now, even though the U.S. housing market overall has slowed, new home building and sales are showing signs of life in the regions just beyond the affluent suburbs. Rising mortgage rates and home prices are once again motivating buyers to drive until they can afford a home. 7. The plight of families divided by the Korean War is often framed as a purely Korean matter. But it is an American issue, too. During the first year of the 1950 53 war, Kim Keum Sum was separated from her two youngest children on a beach in North Korea as they tried to escape. Two generations of a Korean American family searched for years for the two children, a sorrowful legacy of an unresolved conflict. Here is their story. My mother asked me on her deathbed to find my brother and sister in North Korea. And if I couldn t find them, to ask my children to do it. And if they couldn t find them, to ask their children.

New York Times Casper Sleep, the online mattress retailer, is seeking underwriters for an initial public offering. Reuters 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about the proposal by presidential candidate Kamala Harris to increase pay for public school teachers: Jeff Davis, Nebraska Sen. Harris s plan is more central planning and federal overreach. The administration of schools including teacher pay is and should be a state and local issue. If a school district wants to increase teacher pay to attract and retain more talented teachers, that s great. At least the members of the local school board who vote to make that decision will be more directly accountable to the members of their community who elect them. Sheila Barrett, New York Seriously? Configure a plan to improve the sorry state of public education across America. Throwing money at the union vote is not the answer. Dave Meyer, Texas Public education should work more like the business world. Effective teachers change lives and should be paid well. Ineffective teachers ruin lives and should be terminated. Pay for performance will improve the public education system. Jennifer Falvey, South Carolina I fully support the ideas behind Ms. Harris s proposal: that educating the future citizens and leaders of America is a vitally important job, and should be remunerated as such and that the wealthiest Americans need to contribute more to America s infrastructure through greater tax contributions. While state and local governments, not Washington, are typically responsible for setting salaries for public school teachers, as the article states, they have obviously not risen or have risen unequally to that particular challenge. Whether this is due to sexism in a field typically dominated by women, by shortsighted state budget planning, or by the reluctance of state citizens to contribute to educating all of the children in their state rather than just those in their tax district , leaving it up to the states has not worked. Perhaps if the federal government shows its support of the profession by contributing to raises for teachers, we can see properly educating our future generations as an investment rather than an afterthought.

Since we've missed 1 lecture due to an inclement weather condition, the 8th lecture will correspond to April 2nd, which I think is too late. Recall there will be no class on March 19, because that entire week is Spring Break. Given this situation, I decided to cancel the midterm exam and deliver a lecture on April 2nd. As a result, more emphasis will be placed on your final project Final presentation 35% and Final report 35% towards your grade. Plus, there will be a corporate networking event, either in the last week of April or the first week of May. If your project qualifies and your team presents a poster in that event, there will be extra 2% points counted towards your grade. Please let me know if there's any question. Thank you.

This includes retail and dining establishments on the Stevens campus. Starting on January 22, 2019, retail and food establishments will no longer provide single use plastic carry out bags to customers. Instead, businesses will encourage customers to bring their own reusable bags. Paper bags will also be available to customers for a fee. Stevens is committed to complying with and supporting this environmentally friendly initiative of the City of Hoboken as it reinforces our own sustainability efforts on campus and in the surrounding community. The City of Hoboken will be holding an event to distribute free, reusable bags to Stevens students on a first come first served basis outside the Pierce Dining Hall on Wednesday, January 30th, between 11:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. For further information and to read Frequently Asked Questions about this initiative, please see the City of Hoboken s fact sheet about plastic bag use.

A scam call is a malicious call with the intention of illegally acquiring money or personal information from you. These calls seem to be targeting especially international students. The caller may pretend to be from a government agency such as DHS, USCIS, IRS or your home country embassy. If you are not familiar with these types of calls, it can be very alarming and scary to receive one. If you receive a call demanding personal information or payments, hang up immediately. Remember, government officials will never threaten you or ask you for payment over the phone or in an email.

The Spring 2019 Final Exam and Review Period runs from May 9 18. There are no undergraduate exams scheduled on Thursday, May 9, which will be used as a review reading day. Most graduate exams are generally held on the evening that the class normally meets and in the same room. Classrooms for daytime graduate exams may have been adjusted based on space needs. Please verify your locations if you plan to hold your final during the first week of the final exam period. Undergraduate exams are scheduled throughout the exam period, and often in different rooms based on availability. The Office of the Registrar makes every effort to avoid scheduling conflicts but cannot guarantee against them. Students with conflicting exams should discuss alternative arrangements directly with their instructor. While we are generally unable to change the exam schedule once it is completed due to the possibility of creating conflicts, we strongly advise that you check the Office of the Registrar website later in the semester for any updates that may occur.

But, the Homework assignment 4, Problem 3 involves with such a test. Therefore, I will ask the grader not to deduct a point for that.

View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, the Fed stands pat, inside U.S. airlines decisions to keep flying the 737 MAX last week, and the triumphant inaugural run of a new ESG fund. 1. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged yesterday and signaled it is unlikely to raise them in 2019 sending the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury to its lowest level in over a year. The Fed also put a date on its plan to slow the shrinking of its $4 trillion asset portfolio: It will start in May. In a particularly revealing admission, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he is discouraged about inflation, persistently running below the 2% annual rate officials see as healthy. The Fed now believes its monetary policy is back to normal. That should worry you, writes the Journal's Greg Ip. Parse the Fed: Compare the March and January statements. 2. Inside U.S. airlines decisions to keep flying the 737 MAX. Southwest Airlines installed warning lights in its Boeing 737 MAX 8 cockpits to alert pilots to problems with angle of attack indicators, a sensor suspected of contributing to one and possibly two MAX crashes. PHOTO: JOE RAEDLE/GETTY IMAGES Most airline CEOs will say safety is the first responsibility. But when Southwest, American and United decided to keep flying the Boeing 737 MAX after two crashes within five months led carriers elsewhere to stop, it raised the question of whether they were putting revenue and schedules ahead of safety. Three days after the second crash, trailing regulators in much of the rest of the world, the FAA grounded the 737 MAX in the U.S. The only real factor that we were thinking about was safety, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told the Journal. All three airlines say their decisions were largely data driven. Read more about them. From reporter and Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney: After two crashes with similar circumstances, fears were building among travelers. The system suspected of causing problems had already been declared by Boeing to be in need of major changes. To many, the prudent course was to stop flying the plane until the concerns were resolved. Were U.S. airlines avoiding grounding for financial reasons? Carriers insist it s still safety first. Their data, their pilot training and some steps they took on their own, such as Southwest's cockpit warning light, persuaded them it was safe to keep flying. But overreliance on data can leave gaps in understanding. And passenger fears are a factor in decision making. scott.mccartney wsj.com The Middle Seat newsletter: Get Scott McCartney's weekly look at the ups and downs of airline travel. Sign up here. 3. Alphabet s Google was hit yet again by European antitrust regulators. The $1.7 billion fine for limiting how some websites could display ads sold by its rivals adds to more than $7 billion levied in two other decisions since 2017 in the nearly decadelong investigation. The commission didn t order any change in business practices at Google because it says the one at issue ended shortly after charges were filed nearly three years ago. In the past, Google maintained the allegedly anticompetitive practices were legal, but said it ended them to resolve the issue expeditiously. 4. Bayer s shares were pummeled Wednesday, falling more than 9% after a San Francisco jury found that exposure to the company's Roundup weedkiller was a substantial factor in a man's non Hodgkin lymphoma. Since August, when a jury held Bayer liable in another lymphoma case, its shares have fallen some 35%. In early trading Thursday in Europe, they were down 1.7%. The German chemicals and pharmaceuticals maker still faces suits from 11,200 farmers, gardeners and landscapers, turning its $63 billion acquisition of U.S. agriculture giant Monsanto meant to bolster Bayer s fading fortunes into its biggest potential liability.

A new fund from DWS Group, the asset management business of Deutsche Bank, raised $843 million in a single day perhaps signaling a step change in investor participation in funds that use environmental, social and governance scores to pick stocks and bonds. Investors have been slow to buy into so called ESG funds. Unlike older strategies for socially responsible investing, the ESG approach isn t to ban unloved industries but instead to seek out the companies performing best on issues like pollution and pay parity. $11.6 trillion The value of assets overseen by U.S. money managers who consider ESG criteria, up from $8.1 trillion in 2016 From reporter Asjylyn Loder: The hype around sustainable investing might make you think it s something new. But whether called values based, socially responsible or ESG, it has been around for centuries. The modern version traces to the 1750s, when the Quakers banned members from participating in the slave trade. But Christians are hardly the only group to talk about money in moral terms, which is part of what makes it tricky for asset managers and advisers to navigate. Just look at last year s controversy about gun divestment. How do you design a strategy that doesn t offend customers and appeals to a wide audience, but isn t so anodyne that investors don t see the point? asjylyn.loder wsj.com 6. As the U.S. and China prepared for a new round of trade talks, President Trump said he expected to keep tariffs on Chinese goods in place for a substantial period of time, even after a deal. The details of a tariff rollback are one subject of the negotiations. Mr. Trump also said Islamic State would suffer its final territorial defeat by last night, though Pentagon officials said the formal end of the self proclaimed caliphate likely was days away, not hours. In other politics news: The president is expected to issue an executive order today tying federal grants to colleges and universities to their upholding free speech standards. U.S. senators came to the defense of the late Sen. John McCain, a recent target of the president s tweets. The House Judiciary Committee is considering requesting more documents from associates of the president. 7.

Associated Press A labor shortage has Japan s 24 hour convenience stores struggling to stay open around the clock. Reuters Canada s arrest of Huawei s CFO at Washington s request only boosted the tech giant s global fame, Beijing s top official in Hong Kong said. South China Morning Post 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about President Trump s moves to strengthen ties with Brazil: Kevin Ivers, Washington, D.C. A stronger alliance with Brazil is a logical step, and marks a welcome shift away from decades of neglect of the Americas. The non NATO ally designation is particularly important for President Bolsonaro s government because it will pave the way for more meaningful collaboration between Brazil s professional military staff and U.S. authorities on shared national security concerns, which include balancing the influence of China in the hemisphere. Matt Posthuma, Illinois Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world, both by land area and population. It has abundant natural resources and a growing middle class. Brazil has a stable democracy, which has elected presidents from both the left and right. Recent anticorruption efforts such as Operation Car Wash have gone a long way in restoring confidence in government among investors and the electorate. Brazil has a diverse culture that has received immigrants from all over the world. Many say that Brazil is quite similar to the U.S. 50 years ago. It is only natural that the U.S. should promote closer relations with Brazil as a trading partner and political ally in the region. Slade Howell, North Carolina Bolsonaro was elected president as a response to the recent corrupt leaders in Brazil, primarily brought on by abuses related to the state owned oil industry and the pitfalls of socialism. Unlike Venezuela, the change was made before collapse. It is refreshing to have our leaders embrace the president of a country returning to democracy and market economy, as opposed to a philosophy of military regime change and then what.

View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, how the National Enquirer got Jeff Bezos texts, a key executive departure at Warner Bros., and pilot training under scrutiny. 1. How the National Enquirer got Jeff Bezos texts: It paid his lover s brother $200,000. American Media CEO David Pecker Michael Sanchez, brother of Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos girlfriend and Mr. Bezos. PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: WSJ: PHOTOS: GETTY IMAGES 2 , BFA Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his allies have publicly speculated about how the National Enquirer acquired racy texts he sent his girlfriend, including at one point raising the possibility Saudi Arabia or the White House was involved. The reality is simpler, said people familiar with the matter: The Enquirer s publisher bought the secrets for $200,000 from the girlfriend s brother. The inside story of the deal answers many of the central questions in a high profile fight between the nation s best known tabloid and the world s richest man including why the spat became so bitter and public. 2. Kevin Tsujihara is stepping down as CEO of Warner Bros. studio less than two weeks after he won an expanded role in a restructuring, said AT T s WarnerMedia, which is investigating his extramarital relationship with a young actress. With his departure, all the top executives of Time Warner which AT T acquired and renamed WarnerMedia are now gone. 3. Fidelity National Information Services is acquiring Worldpay for about $35 billion in cash and stock one of the largest deals to date in the payments processing sector, under pressure as regulatory scrutiny and competition from tech startups rise. The combined company expects to generate $500 million in additional revenue and cut costs by about $400 million a year. 4. U.S. semiconductor makers say they told the Trump administration not to include them in any deal calling for China to step up purchases of American goods and services. U.S. production costs are so high, they say, that purchase quotas would essentially force them to shift testing and assembly to China. Beijing has offered to buy $30 billion of U.S. chips over six years far less than a previous offer, but enough to essentially double U.S. semiconductor exports to China. From senior editor Bob Davis: Selling any trade deal with Beijing as a win for the U.S. will involve putting together a $1 trillion plus package of exports to China. But American semiconductor makers look at purchase pledges as a kind of Trojan horse for Chinese bureaucrats. The officials will exert more control over the chip industry, U.S. executives contend, ultimately harming U.S. interests. bob.davis wsj.com Advertisement LEAVE THIS BOX EMPTY Share this email with a friend.

An instructor in a Boeing 737 flight simulator in Indonesia. PHOTO: WILLY KURNIAWAN/REUTERS Minimizing costly new training was a selling point for the Boeing jet, but then came two crashes in the space of five months. Boeing said training and materials adhere to international standards and followed a process that was absolutely consistent with introducing previous new airplanes and derivatives. Also under scrutiny: the overall experience levels of some crews. In the U.S., newly hired pilots must generally have at least 1,500 hours of flying experience, but elsewhere some can be fast tracked into the co pilot seat in as little as 18 months, with just 240 hours, including simulator time. 6. The Trump administration is deadlocked over one option for bolstering the opposition in Venezuela and keeping pressure on the regime of Nicol s Maduro. U.S. special envoy Elliott Abrams, who is leading diplomatic efforts in the Venezuela crisis, has advocated immigration relief for more than 70,000 Venezuelans living illegally in the U.S. But the National Security Council is grappling with how to square that with President Trump s crackdown on immigration, asylum seekers and refugees. We have absolutely got to avoid any noncriminal deportations while we sort it out. To send some family back to Venezuela now would make us all laughingstocks. U.S. special envoy Elliott Abrams, in a February email to the National Security Council 7. What We re Following The Red Cross says the storm damaged or destroyed 90% of Beira, Mozambique. PHOTO: DENIS ONYODI/IFRC/ASSOCIATED PRESS Killer Storm: More than 1,000 people were feared dead four days after Cyclone Idai slammed into Mozambique, submerging villages and leaving bodies floating in floodwaters. Netherlands Shooting: Police arrested a Turkish born suspect in a shooting that killed at least three people on a tram in Utrecht, an attack authorities were treating as a possible act of terrorism. Legal Challenge: The accused New Zealand shooter plans to represent himself in court testing the justice system s ability to provide a fair trial without providing a platform to spout hate. Farm Bill: Millions of people in the Upper Midwest were under a flood warning as of Monday, and the agricultural sector of Nebraska alone could face nearly $1 billion in damage and losses. Two Strikes, You re Out: Blindsiding Prime Minister Theresa May, the speaker of the U.K. House of Commons said lawmakers aren t allowed a third vote on her government s Brexit deal. 8. Trending Stories at WSJ.com Civilians, most of them relatives of Islamic State fighters and many unrepentant over its atrocities gather after fleeing the militant group s last stronghold in Syria.

What Else We re Reading Deutsche Bank s hunger for profits and risk led it to lend Donald Trump more than $2 billion. Once he was elected president, employees were told not to utter his name. New York Times Hated and hunted: the perilous life of the computer virus cracker making powerful online enemies. BBC News Israel s computer chip exports to China soared last year. Reuters Hong Kong s government plans to spend $80 billion equivalent to half its fiscal reserves to create artificial islands it says will ease a housing crunch. Bloomberg California Rep. Devin Nunes filed a lawsuit against Twitter, claiming it has shadow banned conservatives. New York Post 10. Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about whether you should share your salary information, particularly with teen children: Diana Perez, Indiana No, of course you shouldn t tell teenagers how much money you make. For starters, while they will understand the amount of money coming in, it is doubtful that they will be able to comprehend the sometimes unpredictable amount going out. There are better ways to teach kids about budgeting than using one s own salary numbers. Secondly, we do not do children any favors when we treat them as co equals by sharing this kind of information with them. Until the age of 18, they are dependents in a hopefully benevolent dictatorship and can make no presumptions about the expenditures of family funds. Mark R. Lindon, Colorado Yes, you should discuss how much you make, how much you spend, and how much you invest with your teenage children. Use it as a tool to teach them how to manage their money when they are out on their own. Teach them that there is not an endless supply of money and show them you have to prioritize. Also show them the benefit of compounding interest. Rita Mitchell, Arkansas Our family emphasized budgets and goals with our financial resources, rather than discussing and sharing salary amounts. This levels the playing field regardless of incomes. We find this accomplishes more and shares ownership of expense decisions. So if a family member s wish for a premium pair of sneakers moves the expense needle too far, a compromise must be made or a contribution toward that splurge needs to be given to keep the family s well planned budget intact. Adam Schutzman, Maryland Should parents give the exact dollar value on how much they make? Probably not. Parents should have conversations about financial privileges and relative wealth. In other words, where do they fall compared to others in the neighborhood and what is an appropriate way to talk about wealth with their friends. Teaching kids not to show off shiny new toys when their parents have money and not to spend money that the family doesn't have are important early life lessons. Marsha Jaroch, Colorado I see no reason to do this. We were always taught that this was impolite and besides, it s no one else s business. What is the point except to either foster envy or ridicule?

Message clipped View entire message', \"Beware of Job Scams and Fake Job offers This week, one of our students told us about a job scam. I thought I d send you this email to keep you on the alert! I found a comprehensive article on this topic. https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top job scam warning signs 2062181. It was written by Alison Doyle, The Balance, March 10, 2019 Here are some highlights. Too Good to be True If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Here are some tip offs that the job is fake. You didn t contact them they contacted you: They say that they found your resume online. They either offer you a job right away or say they want to interview you. Sometimes the scammers will try to entice you by saying that you made the cut and they are interviewing the finalists for the job. The pay is great. You get the job right away. After a quick phone or Instant Message interview, the interviewer immediately contacts you to offer you the job. Tip: Scammers troll job boards looking for victims. To reduce the chance, you ll get scammed, use job sites that have privacy policies and only allow verified employers to view the listings. Vague Job Requirements and Job Description Scammers try to make their emails sound believable by listing job requirements. Usually, these requirements are so ridiculously simple that almost everyone qualifies: Must be 18 years old, Must be a citizen, Must have access to the internet. You wouldn t be reading their email if you didn t have internet access, right? The job requirements don t mention years of education or experience. As a rule of thumb, if it s a real job, the requirements will be quite specific. Job scam emails usually don t include clear job descriptions, either. Many job seekers say that when they ask for a job description or list of job duties, they get the brush off. The interviewer either ignores the questions or says something like Don t worry, we ll train you. Unprofessional Emails Some emails from scammers are well written, but many aren t. Real companies hire professionals who can write well. If the email contains spelling, capitalization, punctuation or grammatical mistakes, be on your guard. Here s an example submitted by a reader: Capitalization errors Human resources should be Human Resources , and yahoo should be Yahoo Punctuation errors Commas, periods, and parentheses should be followed by a space Grammatical errors Human resources have reviewed should be Human Resources has reviewed... Online Interviews via Messaging Services Many attempted scams say that the interview will take place online using an instant messaging service. The scammers often include instructions for setting up and contacting the hiring manager and may ask for confidential information. Tip: If you re applying for an online job and you re told that the interview will take place online via instant message, research the company and its representatives before you agree to an interview. And if you agree to be interviewed, ask detailed questions about the job during the interview. Don t give out confidential information such as your bank account, credit card or Social Security numbers. Don t be fooled just because the interview questions sound real. Emails Don t Include Contact Information If the email doesn t include the company s address and phone, it s a good bet that it s a scam. And it s a good bet that it s a scam if the interviewer makes an excuse for using a personal email address by saying the company s servers are down, or the company is experiencing too many problems with spam, or the company hasn t yet set up its email system. Some scam emails will look like they come from real companies. One reader reported that The scammer s email address was jobs senergy world.com. The real company email is jobs senergyworld.com Tips:: Look at the email address carefully, then copy/paste it into the search box. You can also type in the word scam after the email address to see if someone else has reported the company. Search Results Don t Add Up Before agreeing to an interview, do your research. If it s a real company, you should be able to find information about the company by doing an online search. Finding information does not guarantee that the company is legit, but if you can t find anything, you can bet it s a scam. ALWAYS contact the REAL company or business and ask if this employee exists, that is how I found out this employee was a fraud. Tip: Sophisticated scammers sometimes set up nice looking websites but looks can be deceiving. Try this: go to the Domain White Pages and type the company s web address into the domain or IP address box and click the go button. The results will tell you the date when the website was created. If the website is less than a year old, be on your guard. Tip: When searching for information about the company, search for both the company s name and the email address. Also, copy/paste paragraphs from the email into the search box. Scammers may change the company name but re use the other parts of the email, and it s possible you ll find an identical email posted online. You re Asked to Provide Confidential Information Some scammers ask for your bank account information to set up direct deposit or transfer money to your account, or ask you to open a new bank account and provide the information to them: NEVER GIVE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, DATE OF BIRTH, PASSPORT NUMBER Other scammers will tell you to go to a website and fill out a credit report form or provide confidential information so they can put you on the company insurance. Identity theft scams try to get you to provide your Social Security number and birth date and other personal information. Tip: Before entering personal information online, check to make sure the website is secure by looking at the web address bar. The address should be https:// not http:// Also this is not the time when this personal information should be asked. Sending Money or Valuables, Using Your Personal Bank Account BEWARE: Some of my readers tell me that they ve received checks that look like real cashier s checks. They are instructed to deposit the check, keep some of the money for themselves and send the rest of the money to someone else via Western Union or Money Gram. Then, a few days or weeks later, they get a call from the bank saying the check is fake. They have lost the money they sent. Here s an example from a reader: Once you receive the check, First of all, I want you to head right away to your bank and get the check cashed. Deduct your first week pay which is $500, and Deduct extra $100 for the Money Gram sending fee and proceed to the nearest Money Gram outlet around you to make payment to my wife travel agent. Some scammers ask to use your personal bank account to transfer money from one account to another account. It is called money laundering, and it s against the law. Other scams ask you to receive and forward packages from your home. These packages might contain stolen goods or illegal substances. They Want You to Pay for Something Legitimate companies don t ask for money. If you re told that you need to purchase software or pay for services, beware. Here are three examples. Buy this software: They were offering $15 hr for training and $24.75 to start. I was so excited to work from home and actually be paid a decent wage. The interview went well, and I was told I have the job. YAY! Then I was told that they were going to send me a brand new HP laptop for work, but I needed to pay for the software for it. I thought not a problem I've had to upgrade in the past for jobs. Well here is the RED FLAG! We need you to send $312 Western Union for software costs... Pay for a credit report: The job will require you to work in a high financial environment, so it is our corporate policy that we perform financial verification check on all employees to ensure applicant registration info. Its corporate policy that we have applicants sent through our link, so we are compliant with the U.S employment standards act... Fill out the form and indicate that you want the free report. Here s what a reader had to say about this scam: ...These companies are using the internet to first get a job seeking people to use their site and then be told they need a credit check to apply for a job thru their site, then that company charges an unauthorized fee on your credit card which you used to pay a $1.00 and one time fee for the credit check. Preying on those who can least afford it! Shame on you! Pay to have your resume reviewed: You have a lot of strong, relevant experience and are an excellent candidate although it would be best to improve your resume before doing anything with it. I can refer you to a resume writing expert that can improve your resume to the standard we are looking for, and I believe he charges around $150 or so... Your Gut Says It s a Scam Researching the company is your best defense, but some scammers are very clever. Remember to check the accuracy of the email address, which might be similar, but is not correct! If you start to feel that things aren t right, trust your intuition. Ask questions and pay close attention to the answers. Slow the process down and don t be pressured into making a commitment or giving out personal information. Do more research. If it turns out to be a scam, speak to a member of the Career Center, campus police and/or report it to the authorities. I hope this clarifies things for you.. We will discuss this at the Career Masters Job Search Strategies workshop on Tuesday, March 26, at 11 am, in Fielding, and at the Advanced Career Masters Workshop, Tips for Using Applicant Tracking Systems, on Tuesday, March 26, at 2 pm in Fielding.

The Patent Policy was originally adopted in 2014 and recently amended primarily to update certain provisions and ensure consistency with the Copyright Policy. These policies are intended to work together to address a wide array of issues relating to Stevens research, academic activities and other work in which intellectual property is created or invented. These policies were formulated by a university wide committee with representation from the faculty, as well as numerous other departments at Stevens. They were then reviewed and approved by the Faculty Senate, the Faculty at large, the Provost, the President, the Research Enterprise and Technology Commercialization RETCOM and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees of the Board of Trustees and the full Board of Trustees. Both policies received final approval by the Board of Trustees on December 7, 2018 and are posted under Institutional Governance in the Stevens Policy Library. I encourage the community to read and become familiar with these policies. They are particularly important to the research and other work of our faculty and research staff. Both policies address intellectual property ownership, the rights and responsibilities of various members of the community including students, faculty and research staff including visiting faculty and researchers and the sharing of revenues that Stevens may receive from commercialization of intellectual property. Anyone with questions about these policies should contact the Vice Provost for Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship or the General Counsel.

A new lab space is being constructed in Griffith Hall to accommodate the current Design III lab space in EAS 201. Fire alarm systems, HVAC, electrical power, lighting modifications, a new AV display monitor, and plumbing will be installed to accommodate the new lab space. In addition, an office is being converted into a male and female restroom for the new number of occupants. When will the work occur? Work hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. as needed to complete the anticipated work. Why is this work happening? The existing design III lab space in EAS 201 is undersized and unable to accommodate the increasing number of students registered for the class. By providing the design III lab with a larger space, they will have optimal space and resources to provide them with the best learning experience possible. How will this work impact the Stevens Community? All of the demolition and dust generating work will be completed over the winter recess. The decommissioning of the existing toilet room will remove the only service from the area during construction, which will roll into the start of the Spring Semester.

To prepare the campus for this work, measures have been implemented to ensure the safety of students, faculty and staff throughout this period. Wittpenn Walk will be closed until the completion of the project in academic year 2022 to accommodate construction vehicle access to the site, as well as perform work on the walk itself. A construction fence has been installed from Jacobus Hall to Howe Center additional fencing will be added around Hayden and Davis Halls in the days ahead. As Wittpenn Walk will be used by construction vehicles during the first year of the project, pedestrian access to Hayden and Davis Halls will be conducted through gated crosswalks for safety. Truck traffic will be tightly scheduled and controlled by flagmen at all times to enhance the level of safety as they move in these areas.

Consistent with the University s obligations under the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug Free Workplace law, I write to remind the Stevens community about the University s policies and programs to prevent the illicit use of drugs and abuse of alcohol. Stevens Student Code of Conduct is designed to encourage students to make responsible decisions about the use of alcoholic beverages and to make clear that under no circumstances will Stevens tolerate the use or possession of controlled substances on campus or in Stevens leased facilities. See page 18 of the Student Handbook. In addition, the University has adopted a drug free workplace policy, which describes the health risks associated with the consumption of alcohol and the use of drugs and narcotics and sets forth prohibited conduct under the policy as well as under relevant federal and state law. The policy can be found at this link. All members of the Stevens community are expected to be knowledgeable about and comply with relevant law relating to the purchase, possession, consumption, sale and storage of alcoholic beverages as well as controlled substances. Applicable law and legal sanctions for violation of local, state and federal laws relating to illegal possession, use or distribution of drugs and alcohol are set forth in detail in the Drug free Workplace Policy and in the Student Handbook at this link. Any member of the Stevens community who violates alcohol and drug control laws is subject to prosecution. Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 It is unlawful for any University employee, including work study students and assistants in research or instruction, to manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess, or use controlled substances in the workplace. Violations of such prohibitions are subject to penalties ranging from warning to permanent separation from the University. In addition, any employee convicted under a criminal drug statute must notify Human Resources within five days of that conviction. Wellness Programs Stevens offers regular programming, workshops and events that address the use and abuse of alcohol and drugs. All students and employees are encouraged to attend the annual wellness fair and other programming regarding responsible use of alcohol, the dangers of alcohol and drug use and Steven s policies regarding drug and alcohol use. The alcohol and drug education programs are described in more detail below: AlcoholEdu for College is an interactive online program designed to reduce the negative consequences of alcohol among students. Stevens uses AlcoholEdu as an educational sanction for students who violate the University s alcohol policy. Campus Clarity: Think About It is an interactive, educational online program designed to reduce risky college student behavior. All incoming first year students are required to complete this program before arrival on campus. College 101, a play written and performed by members of the Residential Education staff and Orientation Leadership team, is presented to all incoming students during new student orientation and addresses sexual assault, bystander intervention, healthy relationships, and risk reduction. This engaging and realistic performance not only tackles situations involving consent and sexual assault but also the consequences of alcohol and other drug use, LGBTQ awareness and sensitivity, and diversity. THRIVE is an annual event focused on the mind, body, and soul of our students to promote mental, physical, and emotional wellness. The event features community partners, volunteer organizations, local gyms and wellness centers, informational tables, 30 minute wellness classes, alcohol and other drug resources, mental health information, healthy snacks, and more. Warning Signs educates staff, faculty and students about the warning signs of a student in distress. Included in the workshop is information on how to recognize and respond to signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol abuse. Drug and Alcohol Workshop is offered through the Counseling and Psychological Services Office and facilitated by Stevens trained Peer Educators. It focuses on drug and alcohol issues facing college students. Available Resources Stevens recognizes that students and employees who abuse alcohol or use drugs are in need of counseling and help. We invite and courage all students who have questions or need assistance to contact the Counseling and Psychological Services office at 201 216 5177. Employees who have questions, or need assistance, are encouraged to contact Maria Ouckama 201 216 5146 in the Division of Human Resources in confidence for additional information and/or confidential referrals. External counseling resources may be found in the Drug Free Workplace Policy and in the Student Handbook at this link. Health risks Alcohol is a mind altering chemical which acts as a depressant to the central nervous system. In small amounts, alcohol can produce mild relaxation and a feeling of well being. However, large amounts can cause intoxication, sedation, unconsciousness, or death. Drug use can have a wide range of short and long term, direct and indirect effects. These effects often depend on the specific drug or drugs used, how they are taken, how much is taken, the person's health, and other factors. Short term effects can range from changes in appetite, wakefulness, heart rate, blood pressure, and/or mood to heart attack, stroke, psychosis, overdose, and even death. These health effects may occur after just one use. Longer term effects can include heart or lung disease, cancer, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and others. Long term drug use can also lead to addiction. More detailed information about health risks from alcohol and drugs is set forth in the Drug Free Workplace Policy and the Student Code of Conduct at this link.

A hard copy of this document is being mailed with an accompanying letter from me to presidents of other universities, by the Provost to provosts of other universities, and by the Dean of Admissions to guidance counselors. Topics for future briefs may include faculty achievements and research student projects, achievements, and initiatives alumni success, engagement, and philanthropic support IT and campus infrastructure and other topics of interest to higher education leadership that will demonstrate Stevens incredible ascent trajectory. I encourage members of the Stevens community to make use of these briefs which can be downloaded and the achievements highlighted therein within your professional circles. In addition, I especially want to thank all who contributed to the development of these materials, as well as the many faculty and staff whose efforts have led to the progress depicted therein. Stevens is making tangible progress as a result of your efforts. Per aspera ad astra! This message has been approved by the leadership of the sender's division. ...

Hundreds of students missed their first day of classes, researchers were unable to enter their labs, and thousands of dollars of damage was done to the ceiling tiles, walls, floors, piping systems, and elevator. Further investigation has revealed that a window in a laboratory was open, possibly the entire weekend, creating frigid conditions, causing the pipes to freeze, then burst. Also, on Tuesday, January 22nd, plywood installed to temporarily seal a window in the Howe Center which was removed as part of a remediation project, became dislodged and blew away, due to the extreme wind conditions earlier this week. Once this open window was identified early Tuesday morning, the opening was sealed, but only after extreme cold penetrated much of the Howe building, causing inconvenience to students and staff in the building. Had this situation been noticed and reported earlier by anyone on campus over the weekend, the disruption of cold in the Howe building could have been avoided. Finally, at 7:38 a.m. on January 22nd, the Howe Center was evacuated due to careless use of a toaster oven, a repeat event. All occupants of the building had to evacuate into single digit temperatures as the Hoboken Fire Department was called. This memo requests the engagement of the entire Stevens community faculty, staff, and students to use good judgement in helping care for our physical plant to avoid preventable emergencies. With many old buildings, an aging infrastructure, and chronic cold conditions during the winter months, many unexpected infrastructure challenges arise. Therefore, we need to minimize and, to the greatest extent possible, eliminate those that can be avoided by using good sense. In particular, Make sure that all windows are closed in your offices, laboratories, dormitory rooms, etc. If you notice an open window or a missing window or other unusual situation , please report it to the Center Desk at x5105. Do not chock open doors, particularly those in egress stairs or corridors and those to the outside. This not only creates a potential for freeze ups but also unsafe conditions, should a legitimate smoke or fire condition occur, as well as a security concern. Use caution or avoid altogether practices which cause smoke conditions and result in evacuations. Should a benign activity, such as use of microwaves, toaster ovens, etc., trigger fire alarms and cause an evacuation, please notify the Center Desk at x5105 to report the cause immediately. These events are disruptive and costly to the entire Stevens community, and early reports may mitigate or avoid such disruptions. We invite all members of the Stevens community to work together to ensure that we minimize unnecessary and avoidable physical plant challenges so that we can focus on true emergencies when they arise.

This bulletin summarizes the matters discussed by the Board at its meeting on December 7, 2018.

This necessitated an emergency shutdown of core systems which affected networking, internet, telephone service, and campus wide information systems causing them to be temporarily inaccessible. The Data Center issue has since been resolved, cooling restored, and all systems are now back online with the exception of the student information system SIS . We are currently working to resolve issues with SIS, Student/Faculty Web Self Services, and Student eBilling caused by the outage. These services should be returned to normal operation by approximately noon today. We will provide updated information as soon as it becomes available. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any questions, please contact User Support Services at 201 216 5500.

The cause of this was a distributed denial of service DDoS attack against LightPath, one of our internet service providers. Fortunately, in a short time all internet traffic automatically rerouted to our second internet service provider as it is designed to do. LightPath has now returned to service after their attack. It is desirable for numerous reasons to return the university to full internet access as soon as practicable, with minimal disruption to operations and courses. We will therefore reactivate the LightPath internet circuit at 5:30 p.m. this afternoon. This is not optimal timing, but this decision is balanced against the risk of having only a single point of access to online services including Canvas. Also, internet traffic is at a somewhat transitional time at 5:30 p.m. as well, after business hours and daytime courses, and prior to evening courses. If you are online during this time it is possible you could experience several minutes of disruption that will resolve quickly. Thank you for your patience through this event. If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact User Support Services at 201 216 5500.

Scam calls are made by dishonest people whose primary objective is to obtain money or personal information from you. Their tactics are to scare you with false information or accusations so that you act immediately and without question. Callers usually identify themselves as government officials calling from specific government agencies such as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS , Internal Revenue Service IRS , Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI , and others. When you receive a scam call HANG UP! Do not engage the caller in conversation, and do not ask any questions. It is important to note that the USCIS, IRS, FBI will never call to ask for money or to threaten you with arrest or deportation. HANG UP! TYPICAL SCAM CALL SET UP: Before calling, a scam caller has already gather sufficient information about your through various sources to convince you that the call is legitimate. They will refer to you by name, they will have the name of your school Stevens , they may have information about your entry to the U.S. as an international student, they may have your address, they may speak to you in your native language, and they already have your phone number. Much of this information can be obtained on line or through social media. You will get a call with an automated recording saying that your Social Security number has been suspended for suspicion of illegal activity. Or the caller pretends to work for Social Security and ask you to verify personal information, including Social Security number. The caller will provide you with a legitimate website that identifies the agency they claim to be representing and refer you to the website, and they may also provide you with a legitimate phone number for that particular agency. ? If the caller hears other people in the background when speaking with you, they will instruct you to go to a private place to continue the conversation because no one else is allowed to listen. Ultimately, the caller will threaten you with arrest or deportation or both if you do not comply with a request for money to resolve whatever problem the caller says you are in as a result of your failure to comply with the law. Unless you can provide the payment immediately, the caller will give you a very short window of time, usually two hours, to come up with the payment in the form of a credit card or a gift card, and the caller will call you back for the credit card information. Keep in mind that once the caller engages you in conversation s/he will continue to call you. They will also continue to call if they don t reach you. If you answer a scam call, simply hang up!

It s a difficult balancing act. In our recent survey of 500 business leaders, 92% reported at least one tension within their organization, with innovation vs compliance and process vs vision highlighted as complex areas. The trick is to see these priorities as complementing, not competing with, each other. At this point, governance becomes a part of innovation, not an obstacle. Compliance is more than just about helping your company to avoid fines and mitigate risk. A compliance first approach can build trust, save time and help you react quickly to changes in technology, laws or customer expectations. Join our webinar to learn how organizations are overcoming the innovation vs compliance challenge by: Taking a compliance first approach Maximizing connectivity and providing a 360 degree digital view Creating engaging experiences both internally and externally We will also take a look at how some of our customers made their breakthrough in governance and compliance.

View in web browser Today's guide to the WSJ Good Morning. In today s edition, Wells Fargo s CEO leaves, Lyft is set to debut at $72 a share, and Facebook is charged with violating fair housing laws. 1. Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan stepped down. Tim Sloan in New York earlier this month. PHOTO: JOHN TAGGART/BLOOMBERG NEWS Mr. Sloan s departure ends a 31 year career at the bank and a 2 year effort to get it back on solid footing after a fake account scandal. Wells Fargo said general counsel C. Allen Parker will be interim CEO while the bank searches externally for a permanent chief. Mr. Sloan had been under intense pressure and problems have emerged throughout the bank, which faces a raft of government investigations. Separately, Morgan Stanley s No. 2 executive, Colm Kelleher, is retiring. 2. Many thought Lyft was doomed in the battle with Uber. Now it s a Wall Street darling valued at roughly $24 billion as it starts trading today. The ride hailing company priced its IPO at $72 a share, above the expected range, as demand far outstripped supply. Uber s squeeze was at times so effective that it worried some Lyft investors. But Lyft was able to grow by seeking out unusual funding sources and capitalizing on Uber s missteps. 3. Federal officials accused Facebook of unlawful discrimination, saying it allows real estate companies to target potential customers by race, religion and other characteristics. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also signaled that other online advertising platforms are in its crosshairs. A spokesman for Facebook said the company was surprised by the action, saying it had been working with HUD to address its concerns. From reporter Jeff Horwitz: Facebook has already taken remedial action to prevent advertisers from blatantly discriminating by excluding African Americans, the disabled and non Christians from seeing housing ads, but HUD alleges its ad targeting algorithms can produce discriminatory outcomes in other ways even when neither the company nor advertisers intend to. HUD said it s also looking for a similar problem in Google and Twitter ads, opening a line of inquiry that could be deeply uncomfortable for a foundational part of the digital economy. jeffrey.horwitz wsj.com 4. President Trump is reversing course on the fate of thousands of Liberians in the U.S., extending a program shielding them from deportation days before it was set to expire. The action sets up a fresh fight over the administration s immigration policy. The president also said he was reversing his administration s proposal to eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics. The proposal, like most others in the administration s budget request, was unlikely to have become law. Elsewhere in Washington, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for the speedy release of the Mueller report, calling the attorney general s summary condescending and arrogant. From reporter Louise Radnofsky: The Trump administration s reversal is a victory for lawmakers from large Liberian communities from Minnesota to Rhode Island. But it s also fodder for immigration advocates on all sides of the debate over the fate of much bigger communities: the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have removal reprieves because they are in Temporary Protected Status or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programs. louise.radnofsky wsj.com Advertisement LEAVE THIS BOX EMPTY Share this email with a friend.

The average mortgage rate is fast approaching 4% low enough that economists and lenders believe it will help jump start the housing market again. This week, the average for a 30 year fixed mortgage fell to 4.06%, the lowest since January 2018. Mortgage rates have been on the decline along with the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note, as the Fed pauses interest rate increases and investor malaise about the economy continues. 6. Why Carlos Ghosn fell: Plotters at Nissan feared a French takeover. Carlos Ghosn, onetime linchpin of the Renault Nissan alliance, was released on bail of nearly $9 million on March 6 after 108 days in custody. TAKAAKI IWABU/BLOOMBERG NEWS After Carlos Ghosn was arrested, jailed and stripped of his titles at Renault Nissan, two of the alliance s top executives met in Amsterdam to clear the air. The dinner was an opportunity for the Renault and Nissan chiefs to get better acquainted. It was cordial. Then, almost as an aside, Nissan Motor CEO Hiroto Saikawa dropped a bombshell. It was his belief, Mr. Saikawa said, that some of his executives had gathered evidence against Mr. Ghosn and given it to Japanese authorities with one goal in mind: to derail any possibility of a full combination of Nissan and Renault. If a foreign company came in and took over a majority stake, it would be shocking. Carla Bailo, Center for Automotive Research 7. What We re Following The scene of the Ethiopian Airlines crash near Bishoftu, south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, earlier this month. PHOTO: MULUGETA AYENE/ASSOCIATED PRESS Boeing Probe: Officials investigating the fatal crash of a 737 MAX in Ethiopia reached a preliminary conclusion that a stall prevention system automatically activated before the plane nose dived. The family of a passenger killed in the March 10 crash has sued Boeing in the U.S. Separately, the plane maker and Garuda are closer to resolving the Indonesian carrier s request to alter or cancel its 737 MAX order. Brexit Maze: Today was meant to be the day the U.K. left the EU. Instead, no one is entirely clear how Brexit will end. Sackler Suit: The New York attorney general has filed new allegations against Purdue Pharma, saying Sackler family members fraudulently transferred funds.

Today s Question and Answer In response to our question about Facebook s blocking white nationalist and white separatist content on its site: Roy Farrow, Nevada As Facebook and its ilk are serving as today s town square, no censorship should be exercised by their minions. However, just as the proverbial beat cop was always present at town square gatherings, an arm of our security apparatus should have a place in the system to ferret out potential threats to public safety. Of course, it sounds like 1984, but the internet has changed the world in profound and unprecedented ways, and early warnings are essential. If we can t trust our security apparatus, we re already sunk, and I m from the school of thought that says the government is welcome to become bored monitoring my life anytime. Darrow Zeidenstein, Texas If anything, Facebook s actions are long overdue. Sure, it s understandable that implementing this policy requires some careful thought and the development of company guidelines as to what constitutes white nationalism and hate speech. Yet, the delay in implementing policies to block insidious user content is due more to Facebook s long held stance that it is merely the social platform and should therefore have little to no responsibility for content. In the wake of Russian interference in elections in the U.S. and elsewhere and the horrible massacre in Christchurch, Facebook belatedly sees how untenable its original position truly was. The fact that the particular form of hate speech is today coming from the far right neither absolves the company from its corporate social responsibility nor lets it off the hook from monitoring and potentially censoring other forms of hate speech from the far left. Roy Smalley, Texas How will Facebook define, then determine, the boundaries of censure and stay clear of violation of free speech? Will they apply the same rules to all such rhetoric regardless of the source? Frankly, Facebook is and has been irrelevant when it comes to learned discourse. They just don t know it yet. Dale McConnaughay, Michigan Sadly, Facebook is either ignorant of or unmindful to the nearly century old admonition of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in Whitney v. California: If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence. By enforcing silence on what it defines as white nationalist hate speech, it spares the purveyors of such garbage the full weight and light of reasoned responses.

G MEO GLOBAL MAXIMUM EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES View this email in your browser Visit Us Now In the Spot Light A Trip Organized by Well known Travel Website Trip to Xindu Our students recently had a trip to Xindu, a district in the northern part of the city, organized by GoChengdu, a website introducing beautiful travel spots and nice restaurants in Chengdu. The first stop they visited was a place to learn how to make traditional steamed buns. All of our students had so much fun cooking! After that, they headed to the Valley of Flowers nearby. Later that afternoon, the students were invited to have hot pot in a tree house, where they also enjoyed a fabulous traditional Sichuan Opera Performance! Application is Still Rolling Apply Now Good Times Friends Makes the Best Memories Fellowship Gathering with UESTC Last Thursday evening, the Center held a Fellowship Gathering party with students from the School of Economics and Management of UESTC, a prestigious university in Chengdu. By playing the games specially designed for the gathering party, our students made new friends and shared their lives in the U.S. This was a great cultural exchange experience. Students' Voices The trip to Xindu was so beautiful and exciting! I was able to try so many new foods when we made classic Sichuan snacks and ate hotpot. Watching the Sichuan Opera was amazing, but actually trying the dance moves was way harder than I ever imagined. The opera performers definitely deserve way more credit than we give them! Michelle Reese, Rose Hulman Institute of Tech. Our tour of Xindu was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. Everyone made us feel very welcome even animals! . The Valley of Flowers was breathtaking, and the Sichuan opera, as usual, was beautifully choreographed.
